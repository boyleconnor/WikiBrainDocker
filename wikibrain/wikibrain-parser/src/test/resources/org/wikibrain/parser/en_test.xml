'''Pretoria''' is a city in the northern part of [[Gauteng Province]], [[South Africa]]. It is one of the country's three [[Capital (political)|capital cities]], serving as the executive (administrative) and de facto national capital; the others are [[Cape Town]], the [[legislature|legislative]] capital, and [[Bloemfontein]], the [[judicial]] capital. Pretoria is sometimes regarded as being divided into three sections: West, East and north, relative to the CBD (Central Business District).
Pretoria is contained within the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] as one of several constituent former administrations (among which also [[Centurion, Gauteng|Centurion]] and [[Soshanguve]]). Pretoria itself is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tshwane&quot; due to a long-running and controversial [[Pretoria#Change of name|proposed change of name]], which has yet to be decided, as of 2013.

Pretoria is named after [[Andries Pretorius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2008/09/30/the-slave-roots-of-andries-pretorius-after-whom-pretoria-is-named/|title=The Slave Roots of Andries Pretorius after whom Pretoria is named}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.south-africa.me.uk/pretoria.htm|title=The city of Pretoria, in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pretoria in South Africa is popularly known as ''The Jacaranda City'' due to the thousands of [[Jacaranda]] trees planted in its streets, parks and gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.info.gov.za/aboutsa/provinces.htm#gauteng|title=South Africa's provinces: Gauteng|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Union-buildings-pretoria.JPG|thumb|The [[Union Buildings]], seat of South Africa's government]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pretoria's Jacaranda streets.jpg|thumb|bottom|left| Pretoria is colloquially known as the Jacaranda City because of the many Jacaranda trees lining its streets.]] --&gt;

The [[Ndebele people (South Africa)|Southern Transvaal Ndebele]] occupied the river valley, which was to become the location of the city of Pretoria, by around 1600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabceducation.co.za/VCMStaticProdStage/CORPORATE/SABC%20Corporate/Document/ndebelepeople.pdf|title=The Ndebele People|publisher=SABC Education|accessdate=23 November 2008}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[difaquane|difaqane]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], another band of refugees arrived in this area under the leadership of [[Mzilikazi]]. However, they were forced to abandon their villages in their flight from a regiment of [[Zulu people|Zulu]] raiders in 1832.

Pretoria itself was founded in 1855 by [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|Marthinus Pretorius]], a leader of the [[Voortrekkers]], who named it after his father [[Andries Pretorius]]. The elder Pretorius had become a national hero of the [[Voortrekkers]] after his victory over the [[Zulu people|Zulus]] in the [[Battle of Blood River]]. [[Andries Pretorius]] also negotiated the [[Sand River Convention]] (1852), in which Britain acknowledged the independence of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. It became the capital of the [[South African Republic]] (ZAR) on 1 May 1860.
The founding of Pretoria as the capital of the South African Republic can be seen as marking the end of the Boers' settlement movements of the [[Great Trek]].

=== Boer Wars ===
{{Main|Boer Wars}}
{{See also|Pretoria Forts}}
During the [[First Boer War]], the city was besieged by Republican forces in December 1880 and March 1881. The peace treaty which ended the war was signed in Pretoria on 3 August 1881 at the [[Pretoria Convention]].

The [[Second Boer War]] (1899 to 1902) resulted in the end of the [[Transvaal Republic]] and start of British [[hegemony]] in South Africa. During the war, [[Winston Churchill]] was imprisoned in the [[Staats Model School]] in Pretoria but escaped to [[Mozambique]]. The city surrendered to British forces under [[Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Frederick Roberts]] on 5 June 1900 and the conflict was ended in Pretoria with the signing of the [[Peace of Vereeniging]] on 31 May 1902.

A number of [[Pretoria Forts|forts]] were built for the defence of the city just prior to the [[Second Boer War]]. Though some of these forts are today in ruins, a number of them have been preserved as national monuments.

=== Union of South Africa ===
{{Main|Union of South Africa}}
The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the [[Orange River Colony]] were united with the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and [[Natal Colony]] in 1910 to become the [[Union of South Africa]]. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], superseding [[Potchefstroom]] in that role.

On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital.

=== After apartheid ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}
After the creation of new municipal structures across South Africa in 2000, the name ''Tshwane'' was adopted for the [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|Metropolitan Municipality]] that includes Pretoria and surrounding towns.

Beginning in 2005, portions of the [[African National Congress]] wished to [[Pretoria#Change of name|change the name of the city]] to match the name of the Tshwane municipality, however this met with stiff opposition, particularly from Afrikaner civil rights groups and political parties since it denies the history of the city as founded by Pretorius.

In 1994 Peter Holmes Maluleka was elected as transitional mayor of Pretoria, until the first democratic election held later that year, making him the first black mayor of this capital of South Africa.
Maluleka later became the chairman of the Greater Pretoria Metropolitan City Council (later City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality), then was elected Speaker of the Tshwane Metro Council and in 2004 was chosen to be a member of the South African Parliament for the Soshanguve constituency.

[[File:Pretoria, RSA from above.PNG|thumb|left|Satellite image of Pretoria.]]
Pretoria is situated approximately {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-northeast of [[Johannesburg]] in the north-east of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the [[Highveld]] to the south and the lower-lying [[Bushveld]] to the north. It lies at an altitude of about 1,350&amp;nbsp;m (4,500&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]], in a warm, sheltered, fertile valley, surrounded by the hills of the [[Magaliesberg]] range.

==Climate==

The city has a moderately dry [[subtropical climate]], specifically a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Cwa), with long hot and rainy summers and short cool and dry winters. The average annual temperature is {{convert|18.7|°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;GHCN climate data, 30 year climate average 1979–2008, Goddard Institute of Space Studies&lt;/ref&gt; This is rather high considering its relatively high altitude of about 1350 metres and is due mainly to its sheltered valley position, which acts as a heat trap and cuts it off from cool southerly and south-easterly air masses for much of the year.
Rain is chiefly concentrated in the summer months, with drought conditions prevailing over the winter months, when frosts may be sharp. Snowfall is an extremely rare event; snowflakes were spotted in 1959,  1968 and 2012 in the city, but the city has never experienced an accumulation in its history. During a countrywide heatwave in November 2011, Pretoria experienced temperatures that reached {{convert|39|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, extraordinarily unusual for that time of the year. Again in December to January 2013, Pretoria experienced temperatures exceeding 37C on several days. The all-time high recorded in Pretoria was 42C on 25 January 2013

Depending on the extent of the area understood to constitute &quot;Pretoria&quot;, the population ranges from 500,000&lt;ref&gt;Population, according to the 2001 Census, of the [http://census.adrianfrith.com/place/77612 Pretoria &quot;main place&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; to 2.950&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Population, according to the [http://www.statssa.gov.za/Publications/P03011/P030112007.pdf 2007 Community Survey], of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality after the 2011 annexation of the Metsweding District Municipality.&lt;/ref&gt; The main language spoken in the Tshwane municipality is [[Pretoria Sotho]]; also widely spoken are [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Setswana language|Tswana]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and English. The whole [[Tshwane|Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]] had a population of 2,985,997 at the 2011 census. The city of Pretoria has the largest white population of anywhere on the African continent. Since its founding it has been a major [[Afrikaner]] population centre, and currently there are roughly 400,000 Afrikaners living in or around the city.

Even since the end of Apartheid, Pretoria itself still has a white majority, albeit an ever increasing black middle-class. However in the townships of [[Soshanguve]] and [[Atteridgeville]] blacks make up close to all of the population. The largest white ethnic group are the Afrikaners and the largest black ethnic group are the [[Northern Sotho people|Northern Sotho]]s.

If one considers the lower estimate for the population of Pretoria, this includes largely former-white designated areas and there is therefore a white majority. However if one includes the geographically separate townships, this increases Pretoria's population beyond a million and makes whites a minority.

Pretoria's [[Indian South Africans|Indians]] mostly live in the Indian township of [[Laudium]] and surrounding areas, or in white suburbs.

=== Architecture ===
{{See also|Pretoria Forts}}
:''{{Commons category-inline||bullet=none|Buildings in Pretoria}}''

Pretoria has over the years had very diverse cultural influences and this is reflected in the architectural styles that can be found in the city. It ranges from British Colonial Architecture to [[Art Deco]] with a good mix of uniquely South African style mixed in.

Some of the notable structures in Pretoria include the [[Union Buildings]], [[Voortrekker Monument]], the main campus of the [[University of South Africa]], [[Mahlamba Ndlopfu]] (the President's House), Reserve Bank of South Africa (Office Tower) and the Telkom Lukas Rand Transmission Tower. Other known structures and buildings include the [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium]], The South African [[State Theatre, South Africa|State Theatre]], [[University of Pretoria]], and Head Quarters of the Department of International Relations and Co-Operation (modern architecture).

=== Central Business District ===

The Central Business District (CBD) of Pretoria has been the traditional centre of government and commerce, although today many corporate offices, small businesses, shops and government departments are situated in the sprawling suburbs of the city rather than the CBD. However to bring service delivery back to the people, various Government departments are returning to the CBD. National Departments with their Head Office in the CBD include: Department of Health, Basic Education, Transport, Higher Education and Training, Sport and Recreation, Justice and Constitutional Development, Water and Environmental Affairs and the National Treasury.

=== Parks and gardens ===

Pretoria is home to the [[National Zoological Gardens of South Africa]] as well as the [[Pretoria National Botanical Garden]], one of the National Botanical Gardens in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sa-venues.com/national-botanical-gardens.htm|title=National Botanical Gardens|publisher=SA-Venues|accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also a number of smaller parks and gardens located throughout the city, including the [[Austin Roberts]] Bird Sanctuary..

=== Road ===
The [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1]] is the major freeway that runs through Pretoria. It enters the city from the south as the Ben Schoeman Highway. At the Brakfontein Interchange with the [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] it continues as The N1 Eastern Bypass bisects the large expanse of the eastern suburbs, routing traffic from [[Johannesburg]] to [[Polokwane]] and the north of the country. The [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]] is the original N1, and served the same function before the construction of the highway. It runs through the centre of town rather than the eastern suburbs.

The [[N4 road (South Africa)|N4]] enters the town as a highway from [[Witbank]] in the east, merging with the N1 at the Proefplaas Interchange. It begins again north of the city, branching westr from the N1 as the Platinum Highway, forming the Northern Bypass, and heading to [[Rustenburg]]. The  The N4 runs east-west through South Africa, connecting [[Maputo]] to [[Gaborone]]. Before the Platinum Highway was built, the N4 continued passed the Proefplaas Interchange to the city centre, where it became a regular road, before again becoming a highway west of the city. These roads are now designated the M2 and M4. There is a third, original east-west road: the [[R104 road (South Africa)|R104]], Church Street. Church Street is in the process of being renamed to a number of new names.

The [[N14 road (South Africa)|N14]] starts in the centre of town from the M4 (former N4). It is a normal road heading south through the centre before becoming the Ben Schoeman highway. At the Brakfontein interchange, the Ben Schoeman highway becomes the N1, but the N14 continues as the intersecting west-south-western highway towards [[Krugersdorp]]. The [[R114 road (South Africa)|R114]] parallels the N14 in its westward journey running just to the north of the highway.

The [[R21 road (South Africa)|R21]] provides a second north-south highway, further east. It starts from the Fountains Interchange south of the city centre, but is still a road until Monument Park, when it becomes a true highway. It crosses the N1 east of the Brakfontein Interchange at the Flying Saucer Interchange and runs north/south towards [[Ekurhuleni]] (specifically [[Kempton Park, Gauteng|Kempton Park]] and [[Boksburg]]). Importantly it links Pretoria with the [[OR Tambo International Airport]] in Kempton Park.

A proposed third north-south highway, in the west of the city, the [[R80 road (South Africa)|R80]] is partially built. At present the highway begins in [[Soshanguve]]. It terminates just north of the city centre at an intersection with the M1. Plans have been in place for some time to extend this all the way past the M4 and N14 highways to the N1 in Randburg.

Pretoria is also served my many regional roads. The [[R55 road (South Africa)|R55]] starts at an interchange with the R80, and runs north-south west of the city to [[Sandton]]. The [[R50 road (South Africa)|R50]] starts from the N1 just after the Flying Saucer Interchange in the south-east of the city, and continues south-east towards [[Delmas, Mpumalanga|Delmas]]. The [[R511 road (South Africa)|R511]] runs north-south from [[Randburg]] towards [[Brits, North-West|Brits]] and barely by-passes Pretoria to the west. The [[R514 road (South Africa)|R514]] starts from the M1, north of the city centre, and terminates at the R511. The [[R513 road (South Africa)|R513]] crosses Pretoria's northern suburbs from east to west. It links Pretoria to [[Cullinan, Gauteng|Cullinan]] and [[Bronkhorstspruit]] in the east and [[Hartbeespoort]] in the west. The [[R566 road (South Africa)|R566]] takes origin in Pretoria's northern suburbs, and exits the town to the west just north of the R513. It connects pretoria to [[Brits]]. Finally the [[R573 road (South Africa)|R573]] starts from the R513, just east of the town and heads north-east to [[Siyabuswa]].

Pretoria is also served internally by [[Metropolitan Routes in Pretoria|metropolitan routes]].

=== Airports ===
For scheduled air services, Pretoria is served by Johannesburg's airports: [[OR Tambo International Airport|OR Tambo International]], {{convert|45|km}} south of central Pretoria; and [[Lanseria Airport|Lanseria]], {{convert|35|km}} south-west of the city.

Pretoria is one of South Africa's leading academic cities and is home to both the largest residential university, largest distance education university and a research intensive university.

The [[Tshwane University of Technology]] (commonly referred to as TUT) is a [[higher education]] institution, offering [[vocational]] oriented diplomas and degrees, and came into being through a merger of Technikon Northern Gauteng, Technikon North-West and Technikon Pretoria. TUT caters for approximately 60,000 students and it has become the largest residential higher education institution in South Africa. 

The [[University of South Africa]] (commonly referred to as Unisa), founded in 1873 as the [[University of the Cape of Good Hope]], is the largest university on the African continent and attracts a third of all higher education students in South Africa. It spent most of its early history as an examining agency for Oxford and Cambridge universities and as an incubator from which most other universities in South Africa are descended. In 1946 it was given a new role as a distance education university and in 2012 it had a student headcount of over 300 000 students, including African and international students in 130 countries worldwide, making it one of the world's mega universities. Unisa is a dedicated open distance education institution and offers both vocational and academic programmes.

The [[University of Pretoria]] (commonly referred to as UP, Tuks, or Tukkies)  is a multi campus [[public university|public]] research university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20100523104119724 |title=SA Universities Retrieved 21 January 2011 |publisher=Universityworldnews.com |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in 1908 as the Pretoria campus of the [[Johannesburg]] based [[Transvaal University College]] and is the fourth South African institution in continuous operation to be awarded university status. Established in 1920, the [[University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science]] is the second oldest [[veterinary school]] in Africa and the only veterinary school in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.up.ac.za/default.asp?ipkCategoryID=1127&amp;subid=1127&amp;ipklookid=13 |title=About Veterinary Science &gt; University of Pretoria |publisher=Web.up.ac.za |date=25 August 2010 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the university launched  the first MBA programme outside of North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.co.za/school.aspx?rootid=7&amp;schoolid=25&amp;pageid=additional |title=Wits Business School |publisher=MBA.co.za |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.co.za/school.aspx?rootid=7&amp;schoolid=25&amp;pageid=additional |title=Retrieved 20 March 2010 |publisher=Mba.co.za |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, the university has produced more research outputs every year than any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, as measured by the Department of Education's accreditation benchmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.up.ac.za/UserFiles/UP%20in%20a%20Nutshell(1).pdf |title=UP in a Nutshell 2008 |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR) is South Africa's central scientific research and development organisation. It was established by an act of [[Parliament of South Africa|parliament]] in 1945 and is situated on its own [[campus]] in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csir.co.za/profile_of_csir.html |title=Profile of the |publisher=CSIR |date= |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest research and development organisation in Africa and accounts for about 10% of the entire African R&amp;D budget. It has a staff of approximately 3,000 technical and scientific researchers, often working in multi-disciplinary teams.

== Change of name ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Logo of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan.gif|thumb|right|The current logo of the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Council]] --&gt;
On 26 May 2005 the [[South African Geographical Names Council]] (SAGNC), which is linked to the Directorate of Heritage in the Department of Arts and Culture, approved changing the name of Pretoria to [[Tshwane]], which is already the name of the Metropolitan Municipality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4584211.stm |title=Pretoria name change is approved|publisher=BBC News  |date=27 May 2005 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Pretoria, and a number of surrounding towns are located. Although the name change was approved by the SAGNC, it has not yet been approved by the Minister of Arts and Culture. The matter is currently under consideration while he has requested further research on the matter. Should the Minister approve the name change, the name will be published in the Government Gazette, giving the public opportunity to comment on the matter. The Minister can then refer that public response back to the SAGNC, before presenting his recommendation before parliament, who will vote on the change. Various public interest groups have warned that the name change will be challenged in court, should the minister approve the renaming. The long process involved made it unlikely the name would change anytime soon, if ever, even assuming the Minister had approved the change in early 2006.

The Tshwane Metro Council has advertised ''Tshwane'' as &quot;Africa's leading capital city&quot; since the name change was approved by the SAGNC in 2005. This has led to further controversy, however, as the name of the city had not yet been changed officially, and the council was, at best, acting prematurely. Following a complaint lodged with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), it was ruled that such advertisements are deliberately misleading and should be withdrawn from all media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,9294,2-7-12_2097251,00.html |title=SABC pulls 'Tshwane city' ads|publisher=News24.com |date=11 April 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the rulings of the ASA, Tshwane Metro Council failed to discontinue their &quot;City of Tshwane&quot; advertisements. As a result, the ASA requested that Tshwane Metro pay for advertisements in which it admits that it has misled the public. Refusing to abide by the ASA's request, the Metro Council was banned consequently from placing any advertisements in the South African media that refer to Tshwane as the capital. ASA may still place additional sanctions on the Metro Council that would prevent it from placing any advertisements in the South African media, including council notices and employment vacancies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=594&amp;art_id=vn20070423045707464C538603 |title=SA capital advert row sparks ad-alert threat, IOL |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/business/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&amp;lvl2=buss&amp;ArticleID=1518-1786_2103974 |title=Media can't place Tshwane ads, FIN24 |publisher=Fin24.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ruling, the Metro Council continued to place ''Tshwane'' advertisements, but placed them on council-owned advertising boards and busstops throughout the municipal area. In August 2007, an internal memo was leaked to the media in which the Tshwane mayor sought advice from the premier of Gauteng on whether the municipality could be called the &quot;City of Tshwane&quot; instead of just &quot;Tshwane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2158167,00.html |title=Down with Pretoria signs!: South Africa: Politics |publisher=News24 |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could increase confusion about the distinction between the city of Pretoria and the municipality of Tshwane.

In early 2010 it was again rumoured that the South African government would make a decision regarding the name, however, a media briefing regarding name changes, where it may have been discussed, was cancelled shortly before taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wilson Johwa |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=92376 |title=Mashatile postpones name changes after ‘technicality’. |publisher=Businessday.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumours of the name change provoked outrage from Afrikaner civil rights and political groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/news/local/article287159.ece |title=AfriForum to fight for Pretoria name. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that the registration of the municipality as a geographic place had been published in the [[government gazette]] as it had been too late to withdraw the name from the publication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?art_id=vn20100203042043944C666729 |title=Pretoria name change rethink |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was announced that the name had been withdrawn, pending &quot;further work&quot; by officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=548186&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=6182&amp;Pretoria-Tshwane-delayed |title=Pretoria/Tshwane delayed. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |date=2 February 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politicsweb.co.za/politicsweb/view/politicsweb/en/page71654?oid=158607&amp;sn=Detail |title=Xingwana retracts Pretoria name change. |publisher=Politicsweb.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week, the registration of &quot;Tshwane&quot; was officially withdrawn in the Government Gazette.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.iafrica.com/sa/2208061.htm |title=It's officially Pretoria. iafrica.com |publisher=News.iafrica.com |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jacarandafm.com/kagiso/content/en/jacaranda/jacaranda-news?oid=550881&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=6182&amp;Pretoria-is-Pretoria-again---for-now |title=Pretoria is Pretoria again – for now. |publisher=Jacarandafm.com |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retraction had reportedly been ordered at the behest of the [[Deputy President of South Africa]] [[Kgalema Motlanthe]], acting on behalf of President Jacob Zuma, as minister of Arts and Culture [[Lulu Xingwana]] had acted contrary to the position of the ANC, which is that Pretoria, and the municipality are separate entities, which was subsequently articulated by ANC secretary general [[Gwede Mantashe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadershiponline.co.za/articles/politics/487-government-policy |title=Government policy.'Leadership' |publisher=Leadershiponline.co.za |date=23 March 2010 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, the &quot;[[Tshwane Royal House Committee]]&quot;, claiming to be descendents of [[Chief Tshwane]], called for the name to be changed, and for the descendents of Chief Tshwane to be recognised, and to be made part of the administration of the municipality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article354858.ece |title=Tshwane Royals: 'Change Pretoria for benefit of all'. |publisher=Timeslive.co.za |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''psychiatrist''' is a [[physician]] who specializes in [[psychiatry]]. A psychiatrist specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders. Psychiatrists are medical doctors who must evaluate patients to determine whether or not their symptoms are the result of a medical illness, a combination of medical and mental, or a strictly mental one. In order to do this, they may employ the psychiatric examination itself, a physical exam, brain imaging (computerized tomography or CT/CAT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning), and blood laboratories. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine, and may also use psychotherapy, although the vast majority do medical management and refer to a psychologist or another specialized therapist for the weekly to bi-monthly psychotherapy. 
== Subspecialties ==
The field of psychiatry itself can be divided into various subspecialties.&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt; These include:
* [[Addiction psychiatry]]
* Adult psychiatry

* [[Child and adolescent psychiatry]]
* [[Liaison psychiatry|Consultation-liaison psychiatry]]
* [[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]
* [[Emergency psychiatry]]
* [[Forensic psychiatry]]
* [[Learning disability]]
* [[Neurodevelopmental disorder]]
* [[Neuropsychiatry]]
* [[Psychosomatic medicine]]
* [[Cognition]] diseases as in various forms of [[dementia]]

Some psychiatrists specialize in helping certain age groups. Child and adolescent (pediatric) psychiatrists work with kids and teenagers in addressing psychological problems, so that they are aware of the problem.&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt; Those who work with the elderly are called geriatric psychiatrists or geropsychiatrists.&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt;   Those who practice psychiatry in the workplace are called [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational and occupational psychiatrists]] in the U.S. (occupational psychology is the name used for the most similar discipline in the UK).&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt; Psychiatrists working in the courtroom and reporting to the judge and jury, in both criminal and civil court cases, are called [[forensic psychiatrist]]s, who also treat mentally disordered offenders and other patients whose condition is such that they have to be treated in secure units.&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABPNSubSpecial /&gt;

Other psychiatrists and mental health professionals in the field of psychiatry may also specialize in [[psychopharmacology]], [[psychotherapy]], [[psychiatric genetics]], [[neuroimaging]], [[dementia]]-related disorders/ sicknesses as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[sleep medicine]], [[pain medicine]], [[palliative medicine]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[sexual disorders]], [[women's health]], [[Global Mental Health]], [[early intervention in psychosis|early psychosis intervention]], [[mood disorders]] and [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]]).&lt;ref name=UKReq /&gt;&lt;ref name=ABPNSubSpecial&gt;American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, Inc. (5 March 2007).  ''ABPN Certification - Subspecialties''.  Retrieved March 25, 2007, from http://www.abpn.com/cert_subspecialties.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional requirements ==
While requirements to become a psychiatrist differ from country to country, all require a medical degree.&lt;ref name=UKReq&gt;The Royal College of Psychiatrists. (2005). ''Careers info for School leavers''.  Retrieved March 25, 2007, from http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerbooklet.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USReq&gt;Psychiatry.com (Unknown last update). ''Student Information''.  Retrieved March 25, 2007, from http://www.psychiatry.com/student.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===US and Canada===
In the [[U.S.]] and [[Canada]] one must first attain the degree of [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]], followed by practice as a [[Residency (medicine)|psychiatric resident]] for another four years (five years in Canada). This extended period involves comprehensive training in psychiatric diagnosis, psychopharmacology, medical care issues, and psychotherapies.  All accredited psychiatry residencies in the United States require proficiency in [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive-behavioral]], brief, psychodynamic, and supportive psychotherapies.  Psychiatry residents are required to complete at least four post-graduate months of internal medicine or pediatrics, plus a minimum of two months of neurology during their first year of residency, referred to as an &quot;internship&quot;.&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt; After completing their training, psychiatrists are eligible to take a specialty board examination to become board-certified.&lt;ref name=USReq /&gt;  The total amount of time required to complete educational and training requirements in the field of psychiatry in the United States is 12 years after high school. Subspecialists in child and adolescent psychiatry are required to complete a two-year fellowship program, the first year of which can run concurrently with the fourth year of the general psychiatry residency program. This adds one to two years of training.

===United Kingdom &amp; Republic of Ireland===
In the [[United Kingdom]], psychiatrists must hold a medical degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/training/careersinpsychiatry/careerinfoforschoolleavers.aspx Careers info for School leavers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  These degrees are often abbreviated [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB BChir, MB BCh, MB ChB, BM BS, or MB BS]].  Following this, the individual will work as a [[Foundation House Officer]] for two additional years in the UK, or one year as [[Intern]] in the Republic of Ireland to achieve registration as a basic medical practitioner. Training in psychiatry can then begin and it is taken in two parts: three years of Basic Specialist Training culminating in the MRCPsych exam followed by three years of Higher Specialist Training, referred to as &quot;ST4-6&quot; in the UK and &quot;Senior Registrar Training&quot; in the Republic of Ireland. Candidates with MRCPsych degree and complete basic training must reinterview for higher specialist training. At this stage, the development of speciality interests such as forensic, child/adolescent take place. At the end of 3 years of higher specialist training, candidates are awarded a CCT (UK) or CCST (Ireland), both meaning Certificate of Completion of (Specialist) Training. At this stage, the psychiatrist can register as a specialist and the qualification of CC(S)T is recognized in all EU/EEA states. As such, training in the UK and Ireland is considerably longer than in the US or Canada and frequently takes around 8–9 years following graduation from medical school. Those with a CC(S)T will be able to apply for Consultant posts. Those with training from outside the EU/EEA should consult local medical boards to review their qualifications and eligibility for equivalence recognition (for example, those with a US residency and ABPN qualification).

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] one must complete [[Medical_school#Netherlands_and_Belgium|medical school]] after which one is certified as a medical doctor. After a strict selection program one can specialize in psychiatry: a 4.5 year specialization. During this specialization, the resident has to do a 6-month residency in the field of social psychiatry, a 12-month residency in a field of their own choice (which can be child psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, somatic medicine or medical research).  To become an adolescent psychiatrist, one has to do an extra specialization period of 2 more years. In short this means that it takes at least 10.5 years of study to become a psychiatrist which can go up to 12.5 years if one becomes a children's and adolescent psychiatrist.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematical logic]], the '''Peano axioms''', also known as the '''Dedekind–Peano axioms''' or the '''Peano postulates''', are a set of [[axiom]]s for the [[natural number]]s presented by the 19th century [[Italian people|Italian]] [[mathematician]] [[Giuseppe Peano]]. These axioms have been used nearly unchanged in a number of [[metamathematics|metamathematical]] investigations, including research into fundamental questions of [[consistency proof|consistency]] and [[completeness]] of [[number theory]].

The need for formalism in [[arithmetic]] was not well appreciated until the work of [[Hermann Grassmann]], who showed in the 1860s that many facts in arithmetic could be derived from more basic facts about the [[successor function|successor operation]] and [[mathematical induction|induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Grassmann 1861&lt;/ref&gt; In 1881, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] provided an [[Axiomatic system#Axiomatization|axiomatization]] of natural-number arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce 1881; also see Shields 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In&amp;nbsp;1888, [[Richard Dedekind]] proposed a collection of axioms about the numbers, and in&amp;nbsp;1889 Peano published a more precisely formulated version of them as a collection of axioms in his book, ''The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method'' ({{lang-la|Arithmetices principia, nova methodo exposita}}).

The Peano axioms contain three types of statements. The first axiom asserts the existence of at least one member of the set &quot;number&quot;. The next four are general statements about [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]]; in modern treatments these are often considered axioms of the &quot;underlying logic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:94&lt;/ref&gt; The next three axioms are [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about natural numbers expressing the fundamental properties of the successor operation. The ninth, final axiom is a [[second-order logic|second order]] statement of the principle of [[mathematical induction]] over the natural numbers. A weaker first-order system called '''Peano arithmetic''' is obtained by explicitly adding the addition and multiplication operation symbols and replacing the [[Second-order arithmetic#Induction and comprehension schema|second-order induction]] axiom with a first-order [[axiom schema]].

== The axioms ==
When Peano formulated his axioms, the language of [[mathematical logic]] was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was the genesis of the modern notation for [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] (∈, which is from Peano's ε) and [[logical implication|implication]] (⊃, which is from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained a clear distinction between mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the [[Begriffsschrift]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus based on the work of [[George Boole|Boole]] and [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort 1967, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peano axioms define the arithmetical properties of ''[[natural numbers]]'', usually represented as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''N'' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}.&lt;/math&gt; The [[signature (mathematical logic)|signature]] (a formal language's [[non-logical symbol]]s) for the axioms includes a constant symbol 0 and a unary function symbol ''S''.

The constant 0 is assumed to be a natural number:

#0 is a natural number.

The next four axioms describe the [[equality (mathematics)|equality]] [[relation (mathematics)|relation]].

#&lt;li value=&quot;2&quot;&gt; For every natural number ''x'', ''x'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]].
#For all natural numbers ''x'' and ''y'', if ''x'' = ''y'', then ''y'' = ''x''. That is, equality is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].
#For all natural numbers ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'', if ''x'' = ''y'' and ''y'' = ''z'', then ''x'' = ''z''. That is, equality is [[transitive relation|transitive]].
#For all ''a'' and ''b'', if ''a'' is a natural number and ''a'' = ''b'', then ''b'' is also a natural number. That is, the natural numbers are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under equality.

The remaining axioms define the arithmetical properties of the natural numbers. The naturals are assumed to be closed under a single-valued &quot;successor&quot; [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''S''.

#&lt;li value=&quot;6&quot;&gt;For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') is a natural number.

Peano's original formulation of the axioms used 1 instead of 0 as the &quot;first&quot; natural number. This choice is arbitrary, as axiom 1 does not endow the constant 0 with any additional properties. However, because 0 is the [[identity element|additive identity]] in arithmetic, most modern formulations of the Peano axioms start from 0. Axioms 1 and 6 define a [[unary numeral system|unary]] representation of the natural numbers: the number 1 can be defined as ''S''(0), 2 as ''S''(''S''(0)) (which is also ''S''(1)), and, in general, any natural number ''n'' as ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(0). The next two axioms define the properties of this representation.

#&lt;li value=&quot;7&quot;&gt;For every natural number ''n'', ''S''(''n'') = 0 is false. That is, there is no natural number whose successor is 0.
#For all natural numbers ''m'' and ''n'', if ''S''(''m'') = ''S''(''n''), then ''m'' = ''n''. That is, ''S'' is an [[injective function|injection]].

Axioms 1, 6, 7 and 8 imply that the set of natural numbers contains the distinct elements 0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), and furthermore that {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …} ⊆ ''N''. This shows that the set of natural numbers is infinite. However, to show that ''N'' = {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}, it must be shown that ''N'' ⊆ {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}; i.e., it must be shown that every natural number is included in {0, ''S''(0), ''S''(''S''(0)), …}. To do this however requires an additional axiom, which is sometimes called the ''axiom of induction''. This axiom provides a method for reasoning about the set of all natural numbers.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value=&quot;9&quot;&gt;
If ''K'' is a set such that:
* ''0'' is in ''K'', and
* for every natural number ''n'', if ''n'' is in ''K'', then ''S''(''n'') is in ''K'',
then ''K'' contains every natural number.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

The induction axiom is sometimes stated in the following form:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li value=&quot;9&quot;&gt;If φ is a unary [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] such that:
* φ(0) is true, and
* for every natural number ''n'', if φ(''n'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true,
then φ(''n'') is true for every natural number ''n''.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In Peano's original formulation, the induction axiom is a [[second-order logic|second-order axiom]]. It is now common to replace this second-order principle with a weaker [[first-order logic|first-order]] induction scheme. There are important differences between the second-order and first-order formulations, as discussed in the section [[#Models|Models]] below.

== Arithmetic ==
The Peano axioms can be augmented with the operations of [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] and the usual [[total order|total (linear) ordering]] on ''N''. The respective functions and relations are constructed in [[second-order logic]], and are shown to be unique using the Peano axioms.

=== Addition ===
[[Addition in N|Addition]] is the function + : ''N'' × ''N'' → ''N'' (written in the usual [[infix notation]], [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] two elements of ''N'' to another element of ''N''), defined [[recursion|recursively]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a + 0       &amp;= a ,\\
a + S (b) &amp;= S (a + b).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
For example,
:''a'' + 1 = ''a'' + ''S''(0) = ''S''(''a'' + 0) = ''S''(''a'').
The [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (''N'', +) is a [[commutative]] [[semigroup]] with identity element 0. (''N'', +) is also a [[cancellation property|cancellative]] [[magma (algebra)|magma]], and thus [[embedding|embeddable]] in a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The smallest group embedding ''N'' is the [[integer]]s.

=== Multiplication ===
Given addition, [[multiplication]] is the function · : ''N'' × ''N'' → ''N'' defined recursively as:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a \cdot 0 &amp;= 0, \\
a \cdot S (b) &amp;= a + (a \cdot b).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
It is easy to see that setting b equal to 0 yields the multiplicative [[identity element|identity]]:
:''a'' · 1 = ''a'' · ''S''(0) = ''a'' + (''a'' · 0) = ''a'' + 0 = ''a''
Moreover, multiplication [[distributive law|distributes over]] addition:
:''a'' · (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' · ''b'') + (''a'' · ''c'').
Thus, (''N'', +, 0, ·, 1) is a commutative [[semiring]].

=== Inequalities ===
The usual [[total order]] relation ≤ : ''N'' × ''N'' can be defined as follows, assuming 0 is a natural number:
:For all ''a'', ''b'' ∈ ''N'', ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists some ''c'' ∈ ''N'' such that ''a'' + ''c'' = ''b''.
This relation is stable under addition and multiplication: for &lt;math&gt; a, b, c \in N &lt;/math&gt;, if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then:
* ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'', and
* ''a'' · ''c'' ≤ ''b'' · ''c''.
Thus, the structure (''N'', +, ·, 1, 0, ≤) is an [[ordered ring|ordered semiring]]; because there is no natural number between 0 and 1, it is a discrete ordered semiring. The axiom of induction is sometimes stated in the following ''strong'' form, making use of the ≤ order:
:For any [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] φ, if
:* φ(0) is true, and
:* for every ''n'', ''k'' ∈ ''N'', if ''k'' ≤ ''n'' implies ''φ''(''k'') is true, then φ(''S''(''n'')) is true,
:then for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', φ(''n'') is true.
This form of the induction axiom is a simple consequence of the standard formulation, but is often better suited for reasoning about the ≤ order. For example, to show that the naturals are [[well-order]]ed—every [[empty set|nonempty]] [[subset]] of ''N'' has a least element—one can reason as follows. Let a nonempty ''X'' ⊆ ''N'' be given and assume ''X'' has no least element.
* Because 0 is the least element of ''N'', it must be that 0 ∉ ''X''.
* For any ''n'' ∈ ''N'', suppose for every ''k'' ≤ ''n'', ''k'' ∉ ''X''. Then ''S''(''n'') ∉ ''X'', for otherwise it would be the least element of ''X''.
Thus, by the strong induction principle, for every ''n'' ∈ ''N'', ''n'' ∉ ''X''. Thus, ''X'' ∩ ''N'' = ∅, which [[contradiction|contradicts]] ''X'' being a nonempty subset of ''N''. Thus ''X'' has a least element.

== First-order theory of arithmetic ==
[[First-order logic|First-order]] theories are often better than [[second-order logic|second order]] theories for [[model theory|model]] or [[proof theory|proof theoretic]] analysis. All of the Peano axiom except the ninth axiom (the induction axiom) are statements in [[first-order logic]]. The arithmetical operations of addition and multiplication and the order relation can also be defined using first-order axioms. The second-order axiom of induction can be transformed into a weaker '''first-order induction [[axiom schema|schema]]'''.

First-order axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic have an important limitation, however. In second-order logic, it is possible to define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in the signature of Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.

The following list of axioms (along with the usual axioms of equality) is sufficient for this purpose:&lt;ref&gt;Mendelson 1997:155&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; 0 \not = S(x_1) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; S(x_1) = S(x_2) \Rightarrow x_1 = x_2 \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x_1 + 0 = x_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x_1 + S(x_2) = S(x_1 + x_2)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x_1 \cdot 0 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; x_1 \cdot S(x_2) = x_1\cdot x_2 + x_1&lt;/math&gt;

In addition to this list of numerical axioms, Peano arithmetic contains the induction schema, which consists of a [[Countable set|countably infinite]] set of [[axioms]]. For each formula φ(''x'',''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) in the language of Peano arithmetic, the '''first-order induction axiom''' for φ is the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \bar{y} (\phi(0,\bar{y}) \land \forall x ( \phi(x,\bar{y})\Rightarrow\phi(S(x),\bar{y})) \Rightarrow \forall x \phi(x,\bar{y}))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\bar{y}&lt;/math&gt; is an abbreviation for ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''y''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. The first-order induction schema includes every instance of the first-order induction axiom, that is, it includes the induction axiom for every formula φ.

This schema avoids quantification over sets of natural numbers, which is impossible in first-order logic. For instance, it is not possible in first-order logic to say that any set of natural numbers containing 0 and closed under successor is the entire set of natural numbers. What can be expressed is that any [[Structure (mathematical logic)|definable]] set of natural numbers has this property. Because it is not possible to quantify over definable subsets explicitly with a single axiom, the induction schema includes one instance of the induction axiom for every definition of a subset of the naturals.

=== Equivalent axiomatizations ===
There are many different, but equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, such as the one just described, use a signature that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of [[ordered ring|ordered semirings]], including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.&lt;ref&gt;Kaye 1991, pp. 16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- These axioms are taken directly from Kaye 1991. Please don't &quot;tweak&quot; them, add additional axioms, or remove axioms without discussion on the talk page. --&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[associative law|associative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x + y = y + x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., addition is [[commutative law|commutative]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is associative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x \cdot y = y \cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., multiplication is commutative.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x \cdot (y + z) = (x \cdot y) + (x \cdot z)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the [[distributive law]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x + 0 = x \and x \cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., zero is the identity element for addition.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x \cdot 1 = x&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., one is the identity element for multiplication.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y \and y &lt; z \supset x &lt; z&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\neg (x &lt; x)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the '&amp;lt;' operator is [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]].
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y \or x = y \or y &lt; x&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y \supset x + z &lt; y + z&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y, z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; z \and x &lt; y \supset x \cdot z &lt; y \cdot z&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x, y \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y \supset \exists z \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x + z = y&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; 1 \and \forall x \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0 \supset x \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in N&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.
The theory defined by these axioms is known as '''PA&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;'''; PA is obtained by adding the first-order induction schema.

An important property of PA&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is that any structure ''M'' satisfying this theory has an initial segment (ordered by ≤) isomorphic to ''N''. Elements of ''M'' \ ''N'' are known as '''nonstandard''' elements.

== Models ==
A [[model theory|model]] of the Peano axioms is a triple (''N'', 0, ''S''), where ''N'' is a (necessarily infinite) set, 0 ∈ ''N'' and ''S'' : ''N'' → ''N'' satisfies the axioms above. [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]] proved in his 1888 book, ''What are numbers and what should they be'' ({{lang-de|Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen}}) that any two models of the Peano axioms (including the second-order induction axiom) are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]. In particular, given two models (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the Peano axioms, there is a unique [[homomorphism]] ''f'' : ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(0_A) &amp;= 0_B \\
f(S_A (n)) &amp;= S_B (f (n))
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and it is a [[bijective function|bijection]]. The second-order Peano axioms are thus [[Morley's categoricity theorem|categorical]]; this is not the case with any first-order reformulation of the Peano axioms, however.

=== Nonstandard models ===
Although the usual [[natural number]]s satisfy the axioms of PA, there are other '''[[non-standard model]]s''' as well; the [[compactness theorem]] implies that the existence of nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]] shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to isomorphism. This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.

When interpreted as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]], Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to isomorphism, that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, it may be a nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.

It is natural to ask whether a countable nonstandard model can be explicitly constructed. [[Tennenbaum's theorem]], proved in 1959, shows that there is no countable nonstandard model of PA in which either the addition or multiplication operation is [[computable function|computable]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaye 1991, sec. 11.3&lt;/ref&gt; This result shows it is difficult to be completely explicit in describing the addition and multiplication operations of a countable nonstandard model of PA. However, there is only one possible order type of a countable nonstandard model. Letting ω be the order type of the natural numbers, ζ be the order type of the integers, and η be the order type of the rationals, the order type of any countable nonstandard model of PA is ω + ζ·η, which can be visualized as a copy of the natural numbers followed by a dense linear ordering of copies of the integers.

=== Set-theoretic models ===
{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}
The Peano axioms can be derived from [[set theory|set theoretic]] constructions of the [[natural number]]s and axioms of set theory such as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]].&lt;ref&gt;Suppes 1960; Hatcher 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The standard construction of the naturals, due to [[John von Neumann]], starts from a definition of 0 as the empty set, ∅, and an operator ''s'' on sets defined as:
:''s''(''a'') = ''a'' ∪ { ''a'' }.
The set of natural numbers '''N''' is defined as the intersection of all sets [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under ''s'' that contain the empty set. Each natural number is equal (as a set) to the set of natural numbers less than it:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
0 &amp;= \emptyset \\
1 &amp;= s(0) = s(\emptyset) = \emptyset \cup \{ \emptyset \} = \{ \emptyset \} = \{ 0 \} \\
2 &amp;= s(1) = s(\{ 0 \}) = \{ 0 \} \cup \{ \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0 , \{ 0 \} \} = \{ 0, 1 \} \\
3 &amp;= ... = \{ 0, 1, 2 \}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and so on. The set '''N''' together with 0 and the successor function ''s'' : '''N''' → '''N''' satisfies the Peano axioms. &lt;!-- dubious: The induction axiom is proven using the [[axiom of infinity]] of set theory.--&gt;

Peano arithmetic is [[equiconsistent]] with several weak systems of set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Tarski &amp;amp; Givant 1987, sec. 7.6&lt;/ref&gt; One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation. Another such system consists of [[general set theory]] ([[extensionality]], existence of the [[empty set]], and the [[general set theory|axiom of adjunction]]), augmented by an axiom schema stating that a property that holds for the empty set and holds of an adjunction whenever it holds of the adjunct must hold for all sets.

=== Interpretation in category theory ===
The Peano axioms can also be understood using [[category theory]]. Let ''C'' be a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with [[terminal object]] 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;, and define the category of '''pointed unary systems''', US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') as follows:
* The objects of US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') are triples (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''X'' is an object of ''C'', and 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : 1&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X'' and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''X'' → ''X'' are ''C''-morphisms.
* A morphism φ : (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''Y'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a ''C''-morphism φ : ''X'' → ''Y'' with φ 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; and φ ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; φ.
Then ''C'' is said to satisfy the Dedekind–Peano axioms if US&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''C'') has an initial object; this initial object is known as a [[natural number object]] in ''C''. If (''N'', 0, ''S'') is this initial object, and (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is any other object, then the unique map ''u'' : (''N'', 0, ''S'') → (''X'', 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) is such that
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
u 0 &amp;= 0_X, \\
u (S x) &amp;= S_X (u x).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This is precisely the recursive definition of 0&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Consistency ==

{{Main|Hilbert's second problem}}

When the Peano axioms were first proposed, [[Bertrand Russell]] and others agreed that these axioms implicitly defined what we mean by a &quot;natural number&quot;. [[Henri Poincaré]] was more cautious, saying they only defined natural numbers if they were ''consistent''; if there is a proof that starts from just these axioms and derives a contradiction such as 0 = 1, then the axioms are inconsistent, and don't define anything. In 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed the problem of proving their consistency using only [[Finitism|finitistic]] methods as the [[Hilbert's second problem|second]] of his [[Hilbert's problems|twenty-three problems]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilbert 1900&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|second incompleteness theorem]], which shows that such a consistency proof cannot be formalized within Peano arithmetic itself.&lt;ref&gt;Godel 1931&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is widely claimed that Gödel's theorem rules out the possibility of a finitistic consistency proof for Peano arithmetic, this depends on exactly what one means by a finitistic proof. Gödel himself pointed out the possibility of giving a finitistic consistency proof of Peano arithmetic or stronger systems by using finitistic methods that are not formalizable in Peano arithmetic, and in 1958 Gödel published a method for proving the consistency of arithmetic using [[type theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Godel 1958&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, [[Gerhard Gentzen]] gave a proof of the consistency of Peano's axioms, using [[transfinite induction]] up to an ordinal called [[epsilon zero|ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;Gentzen 1936&lt;/ref&gt; Gentzen explained: &quot;The aim of the present paper is to prove the consistency of elementary number theory or, rather, to reduce the question of consistency to certain fundamental principles&quot;. Gentzen's proof is arguably finitistic, since the transfinite ordinal ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be encoded in terms of finite objects (for example, as a [[Turing machine]] describing a suitable order on the integers, or more abstractly as consisting of the finite trees, suitably linearly ordered). Whether or not Gentzen's proof meets the requirements Hilbert envisioned is unclear: there is no generally accepted definition of exactly what is meant by a finitistic proof, and Hilbert himself never gave a precise definition.

The vast majority of contemporary mathematicians believe that Peano's axioms are consistent, relying either on intuition or the acceptance of a consistency proof such as [[Gentzen's consistency proof|Gentzen's proof]]. The small number of mathematicians who advocate [[ultrafinitism]] reject Peano's axioms because the axioms require an infinite set of natural numbers.

'''Procyon''' (α CMi, α Canis Minoris, [[Alpha]] Canis Minoris; Br. pronunciation /ˈprəʊsɪən/&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Procyon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the brightest [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Canis Minor]]. To the naked eye, it appears to be a single star, the [[list of brightest stars|seventh brightest]] in the night sky with a visual [[apparent magnitude]] of 0.34.&lt;ref name=aaa413/&gt; It is actually a [[binary star]] system, consisting of a white [[main sequence|main-sequence]] star of [[spectral type]] F5&amp;nbsp;IV–V, named '''Procyon&amp;nbsp;A''', and a faint [[white dwarf]] companion of spectral type DA, named '''Procyon&amp;nbsp;B'''. The reason for its brightness is not its intrinsic luminosity but its relative closeness to the [[Sun]]; as determined by the [[European Space Agency]] [[Hipparcos]] astrometry satellite,&lt;ref name=aaa323_L49/&gt;&lt;ref name=GSM/&gt; it lies at a distance of just {{Convert|11.46|ly|pc|abbr=off|lk=on}},&lt;ref name=aaa474_2_653/&gt; and is therefore one of our [[List of nearest stars|nearest stellar neighbours]]. Its closest neighbour is [[Luyten's Star]], about {{Convert|1.12|ly|pc|abbr=on|lk=off}} away, and the latter would appear as a visual magnitude 2.7 star in the night sky of a hypothetical planet orbiting Procyon.&lt;ref name=Annot/&gt;

==Visibility==
Procyon forms one of the three [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]] of the [[Winter Triangle]], along with [[Sirius]] and [[Betelgeuse]].{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}}

Its color index is 0.42, and its hue has been described as having a faint yellow tinge to it.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=166}}

==System==
Procyon A has a [[stellar classification]] of F5IV–V. The [[Effective temperature|effective surface temperature]] of the star is an estimated 6,530&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=aaa413/&gt; giving it a white hue. It is 1.4 times the [[solar mass|mass]], twice the [[solar radius|radius]], and 6.9 times more [[solar luminosity|luminous]] than the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=aaa413/&gt;&lt;ref name=aj131/&gt; Procyon A is bright for its spectral class, suggesting that it is a ''[[subgiant]]'' that has nearly [[nuclear fusion|fused]] its core [[hydrogen]] into [[helium]], after which it will expand as &quot;burning&quot; moves outside the core.&lt;ref name=aaa413/&gt; As it continues to expand, the star will eventually swell to about 80 to 150 times its current diameter and become a red or orange color. This will probably happen within 10 to 100 million years.{{sfn|Schaaf|2008|p=168}}

Like Sirius B, Procyon's companion is a [[white dwarf]] that was inferred from [[astrometry|astrometric]] data long before it was observed. Its existence had been postulated by [[Friedrich Bessel]] as early as 1844, and although its orbital elements had been calculated by [[Arthur Auwers]] in 1862 as part of his thesis,&lt;ref name=auwers/&gt; Procyon&amp;nbsp;B was not visually confirmed until 1896 when [[John Martin Schaeberle]] observed it at the predicted position using the 36-inch refractor at [[Lick Observatory]].&lt;ref name=burnham78/&gt; It is more difficult to observe from Earth than Sirius&amp;nbsp;B, due to a greater [[apparent magnitude]] difference and smaller angular separation from its primary. The average separation of the two components is 15.0 [[astronomical unit|AU]]s, a little less than the distance between [[Uranus]] and the Sun, though the eccentric orbit carries them as close as 8.9&amp;nbsp;AUs and as far as 21.0&amp;nbsp;AU.&lt;ref name=Kaler2011/&gt;

At 0.6 [[solar mass]], Procyon&amp;nbsp;B is considerably less massive than Sirius&amp;nbsp;B; however, the peculiarities of [[degenerate matter]] ensure that it is larger than its more famous neighbor, with an estimated radius of 8,600 [[kilometer|km]], versus 5,800&amp;nbsp;km for Sirius&amp;nbsp;B.&lt;ref name=&quot;Provencal2002&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=apj497/&gt; With a surface temperature of 7,740&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]], it is also much cooler than Sirius&amp;nbsp;B; this is a testament to its lesser mass and greater age. The mass of the progenitor star for Procyon B was about 2.5 [[solar mass]]es and it came to the end of its life some {{nowrap|1.7 ± 0.1 Gyr}} ago,&lt;ref name=aaa413/&gt; after a main-sequence lifetime of 400–600 Myr. For this reason, the age of Procyon A is expected to be at least 2&amp;nbsp;Gyr.&lt;ref name=aaa460_3_759/&gt;

===Oscillations controversy===
In late June 2004, [[Canada]]'s orbital [[MOST satellite telescope]] carried out a 32-day survey of Procyon&amp;nbsp;A. The continuous optical monitoring was intended to confirm [[solar-like oscillations]] in its brightness observed from Earth and to permit [[asteroseismology]]. No [[oscillations]] were detected and the authors concluded that the theory of stellar oscillations may need to be reconsidered.&lt;ref name=nature430_921/&gt; However, others argued that the non-detection was consistent with published ground-based [[radial velocity]] observations of [[solar-like oscillations]].&lt;ref name=nature432_7015/&gt;&lt;ref name=aaa432/&gt;

[[Photometry (astronomy)|Photometric]] measurements from the [[NASA]] [[Wide Field Infrared Explorer]] (WIRE) satellite from 1999 and 2000 showed evidence of granulation ([[convection]] near the surface of the [[star]]) and [[solar-like oscillations]].&lt;ref name=apj633/&gt; Unlike the MOST result, the variation seen in the WIRE photometry was in agreement with [[radial velocity]] measurements from the ground.

===Possibility of life===
Life is unlikely around Procyon, because the habitable zone around 2.7&amp;nbsp;AU from the primary may not contain stable orbits, due to the white dwarf companion with a periastron of 8.9 AU. Also the white dwarf companion to Procyon would have stressed life severely during its [[red-giant]] phase. Procyon emits more of its light in the [[ultraviolet]] spectrum, which may be damaging to life. Still, life cannot be ruled out for other stars of the spectral type of Procyon but such life would have a relatively short time to evolve and would face heavy bombardment from [[comet]]s and [[meteorite]]s as happened in the first few million years of the [[Earth|Earth’s]] existence. Shortly after the phase of heavy bombardment has ended for a planet orbiting a star like Procyon the star is likely to leave the [[main sequence]] preventing further development of life.&lt;ref name=exoplaneten/&gt;

==X-ray source==
Attempts to detect X-ray emission from Procyon with nonimaging, soft X-ray sensitive detectors prior to 1975 failed.&lt;ref name=apj202/&gt;&lt;ref name=apj202/&gt; Extensive observations of Procyon were carried out with the [[Orbiting Astronomical Observatory#OAO-3 (Copernicus)|Copernicus]] and [[TD-1A]] satellites in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=apj228_1/&gt; The X-ray source associated with Procyon A/B was observed on April&amp;nbsp;1, 1979, with the [[Einstein Observatory]] high-resolution imager (HRI).&lt;ref name=apj540/&gt; The HRI X-ray pointlike source location is ~4&quot; south of Procyon A, on the edge of the 90% confidence error circle, indicating identification with Procyon A rather than Procyon B which was located about 5&quot; north of Procyon&amp;nbsp;A (about 9&quot; from the X-ray source location).&lt;ref name=apj228_1/&gt;

==Etymology and cultural significance==
Its name comes from the Greek ''προκύον'' (''prokyon''), meaning &quot;before the dog&quot;, since it precedes the &quot;Dog Star&quot; [[Sirius]] as it travels across the sky due to [[Earth]]'s rotation. (Although Procyon has a greater [[right ascension]], it also has a more northerly [[declination]], which means it will rise above the [[horizon]] earlier than Sirius from most northerly latitudes.) In Greek mythology, Procyon is associated with [[Maera (hound)|Maera]], a hound belonging to [[Erigone (daughter of Icarius)|Erigone]], daughter of [[Icarius of Athens]].&lt;ref name=mw1999/&gt; 

These two dog stars are referred to in the most ancient literature and were venerated by the [[Babylon]]ians and the [[Egypt]]ians: in Babylonian mythology Procyon was known as Nangar the Carpenter, an aspect of [[Marduk]], involved in constructing and organising the celestial sky.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelley11&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley, David H.; Milone, Eugene F.; Aveni, A.F. |title=Exploring Ancient Skies: A Survey of Ancient and Cultural Astronomy|publisher=Springer|location=New York, New York|year=2011|pages=217|isbn=144197623X|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ILBuYcGASxcC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=Procyon+Nangar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ebkT-2BN8fsmAW34riUCw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Procyon%20Nangar&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The constellations in Macedonian folklore represented agricultural items and animals, reflecting their village way of life. To them, Procyon and Sirius were ''Volci'' &quot;the wolves&quot;, circling hungrily around Orion which depicted a plough with oxen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Macedonian Folk Constellations |author=Cenev, Gjore |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade|volume= 85|pages=97–109|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/2008POBeo..85...97C/0000097.000.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rarer names are the Latin translation of Procyon, ''Antecanis,'' and the Arabic-derived names ''Al&amp;nbsp;Shira'' and ''Elgomaisa.'' Medieval [[astrolabe]]s of England and Western Europe used a variant of this, ''Algomeiza/Algomeyza''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi/10.1111.2Fj.1749-6632.1987.tb37197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Al&amp;nbsp;Shira'' derives from الشعرى الشامية ''aš-ši‘ra aš-šamiyah'', &quot;the Syrian sign&quot; (the other sign being Sirius; &quot;Syria&quot; is supposedly a reference to its northern location relative to Sirius); ''Elgomaisa.' derives from الغميصاء ''al-ghumaisa’'' &quot;the bleary-eyed (woman)&quot;, in contrast to العبور &quot;the teary-eyed (woman)&quot;, which is Sirius. (See [[Gomeisa]].) The modern Arabic name for Procyon is غموص ''ghumūṣ.'' It is known as 南河三 (Mandarin ''nánhésān,'' the Third Star in the Southern River) in Chinese.

The Hawaiians saw Procyon as part of an asterism ''Ke ka o Makali'i'' (&quot;The canoe bailer of Makali'i&quot;) that helped them navigate at sea. Called ''Puana'' &quot;blossom&quot;, it formed this asterism with Capella, Sirius, Castor and Pollux.&lt;ref name=brosch&gt;{{Cite book | last=Brosch | first=Noah | title=Sirius Matters | year=2008 | publisher=Springer | isbn=1-4020-8318-1 | page= 46 |url = http://books.google.com.au/books?id=ricStR4SE-UC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=Betelgeuse+Chinese+astronomy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bwndT-6tG4aViAf5082XCg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Betelgeuse%20Chinese%20astronomy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tahitian lore, Procyon was one of the pillars propping up the sky, known as ''Anâ-tahu'a-vahine-o-toa-te-manava'' (&quot;star-the-priestess-of-brave-heart&quot;), the pillar for elocution.&lt;ref name=henry1907&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=Teuira |year=1907|title=Tahitian Astronomy: Birth of Heavenly Bodies|journal=The Journal of the Polynesian Society |volume=16|issue=2|pages=101–04|jstor=20700813}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maori knew the star as ''Puangahori''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best22&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Best|first=Elsdon|title=Astronomical Knowledge of the Maori: Genuine and Empirical|publisher=Dominion Museum|location=Wellington, New Zealand|year=1922|page=33|url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-BesAstro-t1-body-d1-d6-d4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Procyon appears on the  [[flag of Brazil]], symbolising the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]].&lt;ref name=fotw/&gt;

Known as ''Sikuliarsiujuittuq'' to the [[Inuit]], Procyon was quite significant in their astronomy and mythology. Its eponymous name means &quot;the one who never goes onto the newly formed sea-ice&quot;, and refers to a man who stole food from his village's hunters because he was too obese to hunt on ice. He was killed by the other hunters who convinced him to go on the sea ice. Procyon received this designation because it typically appears red (though sometimes slightly greenish) as it rises during the Arctic winter; this red color was associated with Sikuliarsiujuittuq's bloody end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The Arctic sky: Inuit astronomy, star lore, and legend |last = MacDonald |first = John |publisher = Royal Ontario Museum/Nunavut Research Institute|location=Toronto, Ontario/Iqaluit, NWT |year = 1998 |isbn = 9780888544278|pages=72, 231–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''prisoner of war''' ('''POW''', '''PoW''', '''PW''', '''P/W''', '''WP''', '''PsW''', '''enemy prisoner of war''' ('''EPW''') or '''&quot;Missing-Captured&quot;'''&lt;ref name=Missing-Captured&gt;[http://battleland.blogs.time.com/2012/05/17/pentagon-we-dont-call-them-pows-anymore/ Pentagon: We Don’t Call Them POWs Anymore Time Magazine May 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a person, whether combatant or non-combatant, who is held in custody by an enemy power during or immediately after an armed conflict. The earliest recorded usage of the phrase is dated 1660.

Captor states hold captured combatants and non-combatants in continuing custody for a range of legitimate and illegitimate reasons.  They are held to isolate them from combatants still in the field, to release and repatriate them in an orderly manner after hostilities, to demonstrate military victory, to punish them, to prosecute them for war crimes, to exploit them for their labor, to recruit or even conscript them as their own combatants, to collect military and political intelligence from them, and to indoctrinate them in new political or religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/smsajms/article/viewFile/42654/9522 |title=John Hickman. &quot;What is a Prisoner of War For?&quot; '&amp;#39;Scientia Militaria'&amp;#39;.

==Ancient times==
[[File:Abu-Simbel temple3.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Nubia]]n prisoners, [[Abu Simbel]], Egypt, 13th century BC]]
For most of human history, depending on the culture of the victors, combatants on the losing side in a battle could expect to be either slaughtered or [[Slavery|enslaved]]. The first Roman [[gladiator]]s were prisoners of war and were named according to their ethnic roots such as Samnite, Thracian and the Gaul (Gallus).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/%7Egrout/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/gladiators.html The Roman Gladiator]&quot;, The University of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' describes Greek and Trojan soldiers offering rewards of wealth to enemies who have defeated them on the battlefield in exchange for mercy, but their offers are not always accepted; see [[Lycaon]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2013}} for example.

Typically, little distinction was made between combatants and civilians, although women and children were more likely to be spared. Sometimes the purpose of a battle, if not a war, was to capture women, a practice known as ''[[raptio]]''; the [[Rape of the Sabines]] was a large mass abduction by the founders of Rome. Typically women had no [[women's rights|rights]], and were held legally as [[chattel]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} 

In the fourth century AD, the Bishop [[Acacius of Amida]], touched by the plight of Persian prisoners captured in a recent war with the Roman Empire—who were held in his town under appalling conditions and destined for a life of slavery, took the initiative of ransoming them, by selling his church's precious gold and silver vessels, and letting them return to their country. For this he was eventually canonized—which testifies to his act being exceptional.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Early historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate Protestant women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]] captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Phillip's War]] are a fine example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s [[Last of the Mohicans]]. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] continued to capture Europeans and use them as both as laborers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] Coast from 1802–1805.

During [[Childeric I|Childeric]]'s siege and blockade of Paris in 464, the nun [[Geneviève]] (later canonised as the city's Patron Saint) pleaded with the Frankish King for the welfare of prisoners of war and met with a favourable response. Later, [[Clovis I]] liberated captives after Genevieve urged him to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attwater&quot;&gt;Attwater, Donald and Catherine Rachel John. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Saints''. 3rd edition. New York: Penguin Books, 1993. ISBN 0-14-051312-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the later [[Middle Ages]], a number of [[religious war]]s aimed to not only defeat but eliminate their enemies. In [[Christian]] Europe, the extermination of the [[Heresy|heretics]] or &quot;non-believers&quot; was considered desirable. Examples include the 13th century [[Albigensian Crusade]] and the [[Northern Crusades]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Europe'', p. 362–by [[Norman Davies]] ISBN 0-19-520912-5&lt;/ref&gt; When asked by a Crusader how to distinguish between the Catholics and [[Cathars]] once they'd taken the city of [[Béziers]], the Papal Legate [[Arnaud Amalric]] famously replied, &quot;''Kill them all, God will know His own''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Dialogus Miraculorum'' by [[Caesar of Heisterbach]], Arnaud Amalric was only ''reported'' to have said that.&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise the inhabitants of conquered cities were frequently massacred during the [[Crusades]] against the [[Muslim]]s in the 11th and 12th centuries. [[Noblemen]] could hope to be [[ransom]]ed; their families would have to send to their captors large sums of wealth commensurate with the social status of the captive. Many French prisoners of war were killed during the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But when the outcries of the lackies and boies, which ran awaie for feare of the Frenchmen thus spoiling the campe came to the kings eares, he doubting least his enimies should gather togither againe, and begin a new field; and mistrusting further that the prisoners would be an aid to his enimies, or the verie enimies to their takers in deed if they were suffered to live, contrarie to his accustomed gentleness, commended by sound of trumpet, that everie man (upon pain and death) should uncontinentlie slaie his prisoner. When this dolorous decree, and pitifull proclamation was pronounced, pitie it was to see how some Frenchmen were suddenlie sticked with daggers, some were brained with pollaxes, some slaine with malls, others had their throats cut, and some their bellies panched, so that in effect, having respect to the great number, few prisoners were saved.&quot; : [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland'', quoted by Andrew Gurr in his introduction to {{cite book |last1 = Shakespeare  |first1 = William  |last2 = Gurr  |first2 = Andrew  |title = King Henry V  |publisher = Cambridge University Press  |year = 2005  |page = 24  |isbn = 0-521-84792-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done in retaliation for the French killing of the boys and other noncombatants handling the baggage and equipment of the army, and because the French were attacking again and Henry was afraid that they would break through and free the prisoners to fight again. In feudal Japan there was no custom of ransoming prisoners of war, who were for the most part summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_japanese_studies/v031/31.2lamers.html Samurai, Warfare and the State in Early Medieval Japan], The Journal of Japanese Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

Every city or town that refused surrender and resisted the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] was subject to destruction. In [[Termez]], on the [[Oxus]]: ''&quot;all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their usual custom, then they were all slain&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title=Central Asian world cities |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aztec]]s were constantly at war with neighbouring tribes and groups. The goal of this constant [[Aztec warfare|warfare]] was to collect live prisoners for [[human sacrifice|sacrifice]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Michael C. and William L. Sherman. The Course of Mexican History. Oxford University Press, 5th ed. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the re-consecration of [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 80,400 people over the course of four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/sacrifice.htm |title=The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice |publisher=Latinamericanstudies.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ross Hassing, author of ''Aztec Warfare'', &quot;between 10,000 and 80,400 persons&quot; were sacrificed in the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Hassig, Ross (2003). &quot;El sacrificio y las guerras floridas&quot;. [[Arqueología mexicana]], pp. 46–51.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient [[Maya civilization]] of [[Mesoamerica]] more than a thousand years ago, prisoners of war were paraded before the king and his royal court and subjected to ritual humiliation and torture.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/13/news/wk-knight13  The images of wars' horrors]&quot;. Los Angeles Times. May 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], upon capture, those captives not executed were made to beg for their subsistence. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), ''Introduction of Ad-Dahr'', &quot;Period of revelation&quot;, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; He established the rule that prisoners of war must be guarded and not ill-treated, and that after the fighting was over, the prisoners were expected to be either released or ransomed.

The freeing of prisoners in particular was highly recommended as a charitable act. According to classical Muslim scholars (such as Ibn Taymiyya)  the leader of the Muslim force capturing non-Muslim prisoners could choose whether to kill prisoners, to ransom them, to enslave them, or to cut off their hands and feet on alternate sides. Christians who were captured during the Crusades, were usually either killed or sold into slavery if they could not pay a ransom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nigosian |first=S. A. |title=Islam.

[[File:3090 interrogation lg.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Russian and Japanese prisoners being interrogated by Chinese officials during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].]]
The 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the [[Thirty Years' War]], established the rule that prisoners of war should be released without ransom at the end of hostilities and that they should be allowed to return to their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Prisoner of war&quot;, ''Encyclopædia Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Andersonvillesurvivor.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Union Army]] soldier on his release from [[Andersonville prison]] in May, 1865.]]
There also evolved the right of ''parole'', [[French language|French]] for &quot;discourse&quot;, in which a captured officer surrendered his sword and gave his word as a gentleman in exchange for privileges. If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.

The earliest known purposely built prisoner-of-war camp was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document.
Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war.

Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians &quot;of good social standing&quot;, mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some as far away as [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society.

The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality.

Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations.

About 56,000 soldiers died in prisons during the [[American Civil War]], accounting for nearly 10% of the conflict's fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2008/01/national_life_after_death.html |title=National Life After Death |author=Richard Wightman Fox |date=January 7, 2008 |publisher=Slate |accessdate=December 10, 2012 |archivedate=December 10, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CocA9tPw |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 14 months the [[Camp Sumter]], located near [[Andersonville, Georgia]], existed, more than 45,000 Union soldiers were confined here. Of these, almost 13,000 (28%) died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/11andersonville/11facts1.htm |title=Andersonville: Prisoner of War Camp-Reading 1 |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Camp Douglas (Chicago)|Camp Douglas]] in Chicago, Illinois, 10% of its Confederate prisoners died during one cold winter month; and [[Elmira Prison]] in New York state, with a death rate of 25%, very nearly equalled that of Andersonville.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/07/0701_030701_civilwarprisons.html US Civil War Prison Camps Claimed Thousands]&quot;. National Geographic News. July 1, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. The extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (or American War of Independence) and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793–1815), followed by the [[United Kingdom – United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.

[[File:Torture of captain rosinsky by soldies of red army.jpg|thumb|180px|Polish prisoner tortured by Bolshevik soldiers, [[Polish-Soviet War]], 1920.]]
Later, as a result of these emerging conventions a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.

===Hague and Geneva Conventions===
Specifically, Chapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|1907 Hague Convention]] covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These were further expanded in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] of 1929, and its revision of 1949.

Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters and certain civilians. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their name, date of birth, rank and service number (if applicable).

However, [[nation]]s vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During the 20th century, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Russian POW) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners during World War II. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Russian POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labor. North Korean and North and South&lt;ref name=&quot;south-viet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnamese forces routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.

====Qualifications====
[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–5.]]
To be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured service members must be lawful [[combatants]] entitled to combatant's privilege—which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing enemy troops. To qualify under the Third Geneva Convention, a combatant must have conducted military operations according to [[Laws of war|the laws and customs of war]], be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a &quot;fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance&quot; and bear arms openly. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as persons &quot;who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units&quot;.)

Thus, uniforms and/or badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status; and ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[terrorism|terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] and [[Espionage|spies]] do not qualify. In practice, these criteria are rarely interpreted strictly. [[Guerrilla]]s, for example, usually do not wear a uniform or carry arms openly, but captured guerrillas are often granted POW status.

The criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' [[armed conflict]]s; in civil wars, insurgents are often treated as traitors or criminals by government forces, and are sometimes executed. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs, presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.

[[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via Executive Order 10631 under President Dwight D. Eisenhower to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when US forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].

When a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.

Since the [[Vietnam War]], the official US military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and US captives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=1949-08-12 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=WAR IN THE GULF: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=February 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the U.S. Military replaced the designation  &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; with &quot;Missing-Captured&quot;.  A January 2008 directive states that the reasoning behind this is since &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; is the international legal recognized status for such people there is no need for any individual country to follow suit.  This change remains relatively unknown even among experts in the field and &quot;Prisoner of War&quot; remains widely used in the Pentagon which has a &quot;POW/Missing Personnel Office&quot; and awards the [[Prisoner of War Medal]].&lt;ref name=Missing-Captured/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/130018p.pdf Department of Defense INSTRUCTION January 8, 2008 Incorporating Change 1, August 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==

During World War I, about 8 million men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured.&lt;ref&gt;Geo G. Phillimore and Hugh H. L. Bellot, &quot;Treatment of Prisoners of War&quot;, ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'',  Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3 million men became prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368–69 for data.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German Empire]] held 2.5 million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9 million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000.  The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes shot down.  Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.

There was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in &quot;My Four Years in Germany&quot;. Even worse conditions are reported in the book &quot;Escape of a Princess Pat&quot; by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; roughly 25% of its 2 to 2.4 million POWs died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918–1945]''&quot;. Robert B. Kane, Peter Loewenberg (2008). [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]. p.240. ISBN 0-7864-3744-8&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 375,000 of the 500,000 [[Austro-Hungarian]] prisoners of war taken by Russians perished in [[Siberia]] from [[smallpox]] and [[typhus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9406E7D61F38E533A2575BC2A9679C946195D6CF |title=375,000 Austrians Have Died in Siberia; Remaining 125,000 War Prisoner...—Article Preview—The |publisher=New York Times |date=2012-04-08 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany food was short but only 5% died.&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Speed, III. ''Prisoners, Diplomats and the Great War: A Study in the Diplomacy of Captivity.'' (1990); Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) Ch 13; Desmond Morton, ''Silent Battle: Canadian Prisoners of War in Germany, 1914–1919.'' 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] often treated prisoners of war poorly. Some 11,800 British soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the five-month [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916. Many were weak and starved when they surrendered and 4,250 died in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;British National Archives, &quot;The Mesopotamia campaign&quot;, at [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/pathways/firstworldwar/battles/mesopotamia.htm];&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[Sinai and Palestine campaign]] 217 Australian and unknown numbers of British, New Zealand and Indian soldiers were captured by Ottoman Empire forces. About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. [[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed. About 25% of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, while only one officer died.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dennis, Jeffrey Grey, Ewan Morris, Robin Prior with Jean Bou, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'' (2008) p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.S. Gullett, ''Official History of Australia in the War of 1914–18, Vol. VII The Australian Imperial Force in Sinai and Palestine'' (1941) pp. 620–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most curious case came in Russia where the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] of [[Czechoslovak]] prisoners (from the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army): they were released in 1917, armed themselves, briefly culminating into a military and diplomatic force during the [[Russian Civil War]].

===Release of prisoners===

At the end of the war in 1918 there were believed to be 140,000 British prisoners of war in Germany, including 3,000{{citation needed|date = June 2010}}&lt;!-- Switzerland is 100s of kilometers from the British zone of combat operations, what were they doing there and how did they get there? --&gt; internees held in neutral Switzerland. The first British prisoners were released and reached [[Calais]] on 15 November. Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].

On 13 December 1918 the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.

Upon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and &quot;boarded&quot; before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph. It read as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ImagesandBroadcasts/TheQueenandtechnology.aspx |title=The Queen and technology |publisher=Royal.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&quot;The Queen joins me in welcoming you on your release from the miseries &amp; hardships, which you have endured with so much patience and courage.

During these many months of trial, the early rescue of our gallant Officers &amp; Men from the cruelties of their captivity has been uppermost in our thoughts.

We are thankful that this longed for day has arrived, &amp; that back in the old Country you will be able once more to enjoy the happiness of a home &amp; to see good days among those who anxiously look for your return.
George R.I.&quot;}}

While the Allied prisoners were sent home at the end of the war, the same treatment was not granted to [[Central Powers]] prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of which had to serve as [[forced labour]], e.g. in France, until 1920. They were released after many approaches by the [[ICRC]] to the [[Allied Supreme Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ Search&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of POWs by the Axis===
{{See also|Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Japanese war crimes}}

====Empire of Japan====
The [[Empire of Japan]], which had signed but never ratified the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Second Geneva Convention of 1929]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=305&amp;ps=S |title=International Humanitarian Law – State Parties / Signatories |publisher=Icrc.org |date=1929-07-27 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; also did not treat prisoners of war in accordance with international agreements, including provisions of the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)]], either during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] or during the [[Pacific War]] because the Japanese viewed surrender as dishonorable. Moreover, according to a directive ratified on 5 August 1937 by [[Hirohito]], the constraints of the Hague Conventions were explicitly removed on Chinese prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Akira Fujiwara, ''Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu'', Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû 9, 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Prisoners of war from China, the United States, Australia, Britain, Canada, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand and the Philippines held by the Japanese armed forces were subject to murder, beatings, summary punishment, brutal treatment, [[Slavery in Japan|forced labour]], [[Unit 731|medical experimentation]], starvation rations and poor medical treatment.  The most notorious use of forced labour was in the construction of the Burma–Thailand [[Death Railway]]. After March 20, 1943, the Imperial Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-491548/Alive-safe-brutal-Japanese-soldiers-butchered-20-000-Allied-seamen-cold-blood.html|author=Blundell, Nigel|title=Alive and safe, the brutal Japanese soldiers who butchered 20,000 Allied seamen in cold blood|publisher=Mail Online (Associated Newspapers Ltd.)|date=November 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the findings of the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Tribunal]], the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1%, seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Yuki Tanaka, ''Hidden Horrors'', 1996, pp. 2, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The death rate of Chinese was much larger. Thus, while 37,583 prisoners from the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Dominions, 28,500 from the Netherlands and 14,473 from the United States were released after the [[surrender of Japan]], the number for the Chinese was only 56.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, ibid., Herbert Bix, ''Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan'', 2001, p. 360&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, it became clear that there existed a high command order – issued from the War Ministry in Tokyo – to kill all remaining POWs.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_atrocities.html title=Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines]&quot;. Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)&lt;/ref&gt;

No direct access to the POWs was provided to the [[International Red Cross]].  Escapes among Caucasian prisoners were almost impossible because of the difficulty of men of Caucasian descent hiding in Asiatic societies.&lt;ref&gt;''Prisoners of the Japanese : POWs of World War II in the Pacific''—by Gavin Dawes, ISBN 0-688-14370-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Allied POW camps and ship-transports were sometimes accidental targets of Allied attacks. The number of deaths which occurred when Japanese &quot;[[hell ship]]s&quot;—unmarked transport ships in which POWs were transported in harsh conditions—were attacked by US Navy submarines was particularly high. Gavan Daws has calculated that &quot;of all POWs who died in the Pacific War, one in three was killed on the water by friendly fire&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawes|first=Gavan|title=Prisoners of the Japanese: POWs of World War II in the Pacific|year=1994|publisher=Scribe Publications|isbn=1-920769-12-9|pages=295–297|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daves states that 10,800 of the 50,000 POWs shipped by the Japanese were killed at sea&lt;ref&gt;Daws (1994), p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; while Donald L. Miller states that &quot;approximately 21,000 Allied POWs died at sea, about 19,000 of them killed by friendly fire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Donald L. Miller &quot;D-Days in the Pacific&quot;, p. 317&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Life in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as [[Jack Bridger Chalker]], [[Philip Meninsky]], [[Ashley George Old]] and [[Ronald Searle]]. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the &quot;canvas&quot;. Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.

Research into the conditions of the camps has been conducted by The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.captivememories.org.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====

=====French soldiers=====
{{main|French prisoners of war in World War II}}
After the French armies surrendered in summer 1940, Germany seized 2 million French prisoners of war and sent them to camps in Germany. About one third were released on various terms. Of the remainder, the officers and non-commissioned officers were kept in camps and did not work.  The privates were sent out to work. About half of them worked for German agriculture, where food supplies were adequate and controls were lenient. The others work in factories or mines, where conditions were much harsher.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Vinen, ''The Unfree French: Life under the Occupation'' (2006) pp 183–214&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Western Allies POWs=====
Germany and Italy generally treated prisoners from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]], France, the USA and other western Allies in accordance with the [[Geneva Convention (1929)]], which had been signed by these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicr.org/ihl.nsf/WebSign?ReadForm&amp;id=305&amp;ps=P |title=International Humanitarian Law—State Parties / Signatories |publisher=Cicr.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, western Allied officers were not usually made to work and some personnel of lower rank were usually compensated, or not required to work either. The main complaints of western Allied prisoners of war in [[German Army]] POW camps—especially during the last two years of the war—concerned shortages of food.
[[File:American POWs AF Museum.jpg|left|thumb|Representation of a &quot;Forty-and-eight&quot; boxcar used to transport American POWs in Germany during World War 2.]]
Only a small proportion of western Allied POWs who were [[Jew]]s—or whom the Nazis believed to be Jewish—were killed as part of [[the Holocaust]] or were subjected to other [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] policies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  For example, Major [[Yitzhak Ben-Aharon]], a [[Palestinian Jew]] who had enlisted in the British Army, and who was captured by the Germans in [[Greek Campaign|Greece in 1941]], experienced four years of captivity under entirely normal conditions for POWs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/Gallery+of+People+(Biographies)/Ben+Aharon+Yitzhak.htm |title=Ben Aharon Yitzhak |publisher=Jafi.org.il |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:pow telegram.jpg|thumb|Telegram notifying parents of an American POW of his capture by Germany]]
However, a small number of Allied personnel were sent to concentration camps, for a variety of reasons including being Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=295291169228827 Joseph Robert White, 2006, “Flint Whitlock. Given Up for Dead: American GIs in the Nazi Concentration Camp at Berga”] (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; As the US historian Joseph Robert White put it: &quot;An important exception ... is the sub-camp for U.S. POWs at [[Berga, Thuringia|Berga an der Elster]], officially called ''[[Arbeitslager|Arbeitskommando]] 625'' [also known as ''[[Stalag IX-B]]'']. Berga was the deadliest work detachment for American captives in Germany. 73 men who participated, or 21 percent of the detachment, perished in two months. 80 of the 350 POWs were Jews.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Another well-known example was a group of 168 [[Australia]]n, [[United Kingdom|British]], [[Canada|Canadian]], [[New Zealand]] and US aviators who were held for two months at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]];&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=historgokhopdkhpofkofkofjkhjkhjkhojkv luvnbdy/secondwar/fact_sheets/pow Veterans Affairs Canada, 2006, “Prisoners of War in the Second World War”]{{dead link|date=April 2012}} and [http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1575 National Museum of the USAF, “Allied Victims of the Holocaust”].&lt;/ref&gt; two of the POWs died at Buchenwald. Two possible reasons have been suggested for this incident: German authorities wanted to make an example of ''[[terror bombing|Terrorflieger]]'' (“terrorist aviators”) and/or these aircrews were classified as spies, because they had been disguised as civilians when they were apprehended.

Information on conditions in the stalags is contradictory depending on the source. Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labor. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid. One American admitted &quot;The only difference between the stalags and concentration camps was that we weren't gassed or shot in the former. I do not recall a single act of compassion or mercy on the part of the Germans.&quot; Typical meals consisted of a bread slice and watery potato soup, which however was still more substantial than what Russian POWs or concentration camp inmates received. Another prisoner stated that &quot;The German plan was to keep us alive, yet weakened enough that we wouldn't attempt escape.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, pp 360&lt;/ref&gt;

As Soviet ground forces approached some POW camps in early 1945, German guards [[The March (1945)|forced western Allied POWs to walk]] long distances towards central Germany, often in extreme winter weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  It is estimated that, out of 257,000 POWs, about 80,000 were subject to such marches and up to 3,500 of them died as a result.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

=====Eastern European POWs=====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B21845, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene im Lager.jpg|left|thumb|An improvised camp for Soviet POWs. Between June 1941 and January 1942, the Nazis killed an estimated 2.8 million Soviet prisoners of war, whom they viewed as &quot;[[Untermensch|subhuman]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goldhagen, ''Hitler's Willing Executioners'' (p. 290)—&quot;2.8 million young, healthy Soviet POWs&quot; killed by the Germans, &quot;mainly by starvation ... in less than eight months&quot; of 1941–42, before &quot;the decimation of Soviet POWs ... was stopped&quot; and the Germans &quot;began to use them as laborers&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Germany did not apply the same standard of treatment to non-western prisoners, especially many [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] POWs who suffered harsh conditions and died in large numbers while in captivity.

Between 1941 and 1945, the Axis powers took about 5.7 million Soviet prisoners.

With the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria (1945)|Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] in 1945 Japanese soldiers became prisoners in the Soviet Union, where they, just as other Axis POWs, had to remain as labour for several years.

There were stories during the Cold War to the effect that 23,000 Americans who had been held in German POW camps were seized by the Soviets and never repatriated. This myth had been perpetuated after the release of people like [[John H. Noble]]. Careful scholarly studies have demonstrated this is a myth based on a misinterpretation of a telegram that was talking about Russian prisoners held in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Paul M.

According to [[Stephen E. Ambrose]], of the roughly 1,000 US combat veterans that he had interviewed, only one admitted to shooting a prisoner, saying that he &quot;felt remorse, but would do it again&quot;. However, one-third told him they had seen US troops kill German prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[[James J.

March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

Towards the end of the war in Europe, as large numbers of Axis soldiers surrendered,  the US created the designation of [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (DEF) so as not to treat prisoners as POWs. A lot of these soldiers were kept in open fields in various [[Rheinwiesenlager]]s. Controversy has arisen about how Eisenhower managed these prisoners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958673,00.html | work=Time | title=Ike's Revenge? | date=2 October 1989 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see ''[[Other Losses]]'').

After the surrender of Germany in May 1945, the POW status of the German prisoners was in many cases maintained, and they were for several years used as forced labour in countries such as the UK and France. Many died when forced to clear minefields in Norway, France etc.; &quot;by September 1945 it was estimated by the French authorities that two thousand prisoners were being maimed and killed each month in accidents&quot;&lt;ref&gt;S. P. MacKenzie &quot;The Treatment of Prisoners of War in World War II&quot; The Journal of Modern History, Vol. 66, No. 3. (September 1994), pp. 487–520.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Footnote to: K. W.

In 1946 the UK had more than 400,000 German prisoners, many had been transferred from POW camps in the US and Canada. Many of these were for over three years after the German surrender used as forced labour, as a form of &quot;reparations&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noam Chomsky 1979 pp. 35&quot;&gt;Noam Chomsky, Edward S.

Not only Russia made use of such labour. France was given hundreds of thousands of German prisoners of war captured by the Americans, and their physical condition became so bad that the American Army authorities themselves protested. In England and the United States, too, German prisoners of war were being put to work long after the surrender, and in Russia thousands of them worked until the mid-50's.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The POWs referred to themselves as 'slave labour', with some justice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Noam Chomsky 1979 pp. 35&quot;/&gt; Their emotional state was worsened &quot;from the anxiety and hope of the first half of 1946 to the depression and nihilism of 1948.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Noam Chomsky 1979 pp. 35&quot;/&gt; A public debate ensued in the UK, where words such as &quot;forced labour&quot;, &quot;slaves&quot;, &quot;slave labour&quot; were increasingly used in the media and in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;German migrants&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Inge Weber-Newth | coauthors = Johannes-Dieter Steinert | title = German migrants in post-war Britain: an enemy embrace | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=hSxK1Hus-BIC | accessdate = 2009-12-15 | year = 2006 | publisher = Routledge | isbn =978-0-7146-5657-1| pages = 24–30 | chapter = Chapter 2: Immigration policy—immigrant policy  | quote = Views in the Media were mirrored in the House of commons, where the arguments were characterized by a series of questions, the substance of which were always the same.

The &quot;[[London Cage]]&quot;, an [[MI19]] prisoner of war facility in the UK used for interrogating prisoners before they were sent to prison camps during and immediately after World War II, was subject to allegations of torture.&lt;ref name='Secrets'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ian | last=Cobain | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The secrets of the London Cage | date=2005-11-12 | publisher= | url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/nov/12/secondworldwar.world | work =The Guardian | pages = | accessdate = 2009-01-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the German surrender, the International Red Cross was prohibited from providing aid such as food or visiting prisoner camps in Germany. However, after making approaches to the Allies in the autumn of 1945 it was allowed to investigate the camps in the British and French occupation zones of Germany, as well as to provide relief to the prisoners held there.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;&gt;Staff. [http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/57jnwx?opendocument ICRC in WW II: German prisoners of war in Allied hands], 2 February 2005&lt;!--Retrieved 12 August 2008--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On February 4, 1946, the Red Cross was permitted to visit and assist prisoners also in the US occupation zone of Germany, although only with very small quantities of food. &quot;During their visits, the delegates observed that German prisoners of war were often detained in appalling conditions. They drew the attention of the authorities to this fact, and gradually succeeded in getting some improvements made&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2005&quot;/&gt;

The Allies also shipped POWs between them, with for example 6,000 German officers transferred from Western Allied camps to the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] that now was under Soviet Union administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEFDA163EF934A25751C1A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Ex-Death Camp Tells Story Of Nazi and Soviet Horrors | first=Desmond | last=Butler | date=December 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US also shipped 740,000 German POWs as forced labourers to France from where newspaper reports told of very bad treatment. Judge [[Robert H. Jackson]], Chief US prosecutor in the [[Nuremberg trials]], in October 1945 told US President [[Harry S. Truman]] that the Allies themselves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practicing it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David Lubań, &quot;Legal Modernism&quot;, Univ of Michigan Press, 1994.

Hungarians became POWs of the Western Allies. Some of these were, like Germans, used as forced labour in France after the cessation of hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/francia/francia.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====

[[File:OkinawaJapanesePOW.jpg|thumb|A group of Japanese captured during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]]]
Although thousands of Japanese were taken prisoner, most fought until they were killed or committed suicide. Of the 22,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], over 20,000 were killed and only 216 were taken prisoner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Morison | first = Samuel Eliot | authorlink = Samuel Eliot Morison | origyear = 1960 | year = 2002 | title = Victory in the Pacific, 1945 |series=Volume 14 of ''[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]] | publisher = University of Illinois Press | location = Urbana, Illinois | isbn = 0-252-07065-8 | oclc = 49784806}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 30,000 Japanese troops that defended [[Saipan]], fewer than 1,000 remained alive at battle's end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-saipan.htm Battle of Saipan], historynet.com&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese prisoners sent to camps fared well; however, some Japanese were killed when trying to surrender or were massacred&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/1495651/American-troops-murdered-Japanese-PoWs.html American troops 'murdered Japanese PoWs'], &quot;American and Australian soldiers massacred Japanese prisoners of war&quot; according to The Faraway War by Prof Richard Aldrich of Nottingham University. From the diaries of Charles Lindberg: as told by a US officer, &quot;Oh, we could take more if we wanted to&quot;, one of the officers replied. &quot;But our boys don't like to take prisoners.&quot; &quot;It doesn't encourage the rest to surrender when they hear of their buddies being marched out on the flying field and machine-guns turned loose on them.&quot; On Australian soldiers attitudes [[Eddie Stanton]] is quoted: &quot;Japanese are still being shot all over the place&quot;, &quot;The necessity for capturing them has ceased to worry anyone. Nippo soldiers are just so much machine-gun practice. Too many of our soldiers are tied up guarding them.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; just after they had surrendered (see [[Allied war crimes during World War II#The Pacific|Allied war crimes during World War II in the Pacific]]). In some instances, Japanese prisoners were tortured by a variety of methods.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623&gt;{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/index.html| title=Photos document brutality in Shanghai| publisher=CNN| date=September 23, 1996| accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A method of torture used by the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA) included suspending the prisoner by the neck in a wooden cage until they died.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/image2.lg.jpg CNN] September 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In very rare cases, some were beheaded by sword, and a severed head was once used as a soccer ball by Chinese National Revolutionary Army (NRA) soldiers.&lt;ref name=cnn19969623/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9609/23/rare.photos/image3.lg.jpg CNN] September 23, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war many Japanese were kept on as [[Japanese Surrendered Personnel]] until mid-1947 and used as forced labour doing menial tasks, while 35,000 were kept on in arms within their wartime military organisation and under their own officers and used in combat alongside British troops seeking to suppress the independence movements in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and [[French Indochina]].

====Italians====

In 1943 Italy overthrew Mussolini, and became a co-belligerent with the Allies. This did not mean any change in status for Italian POWs however, since due to the labour shortages in the UK and the USA they were retained as POWs there.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In September 1943, Italian officers were arrested and taken to German internment camps in East Europe, where they were held for the duration of WW2. The International Red Cross could do nothing for them, as they were not regarded as POW's, but the prisoners held the status of &quot;Military Internees&quot;. Treatment of the prisoners was generally poor. The author Giovanni Guareschi was among those interned and wrote about this time in his life. The book was translated and published as &quot;My Secret Diary&quot;. He wrote about the hungers of semi-starvation, the casual murder of individual prisoners by guards and how when they were released (now in a German camp) they found a deserted German town, filled with foodstuffs that they (with other released prisoners) ate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

====Cossacks====

On 11 February 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the United States and the United Kingdom signed a Repatriation Agreement with the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation — The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation of this Agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Russians ([[Operation Keelhaul]]) regardless of their wishes. The forced repatriation operations took place in 1945–1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hillsdale.edu/news/imprimis/archive/issue.asp?year=1988&amp;month=12 |title=Forced Repatriation to the Soviet Union: The Secret Betrayal |publisher=Hillsdale.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transfers between the Allies====
The United States handed over 740,000 German prisoners to France, a signatory of the Geneva Convention. The Soviet Union had not signed the Geneva Convention. According to Edward Peterson the U.S. chose to hand over several hundred thousand German prisoners to the Soviet Union in May 1945 as a &quot;gesture of friendship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edward N. Peterson, The American Occupation of Germany, pp 42, 116, &quot;Some hundreds of thousands who had fled to the Americans to avoid being taken prisoner by the Russians were turned over in May to the Red Army in a gesture of friendship.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. forces also refused to accept the surrender of German troops attempting to surrender to them in [[Saxony]] and [[Bohemia]], and handed them over to the Soviet Union instead.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, &quot;Prisoner Taking and Prisoner Killing in the Age of Total War: Towards a Political Economy of Military Defeat&quot; War in History 2004 11 (2) 148–192 pg. 189, (footnote, referenced to: [[Heinz Nawratil]], Die deutschen Nachkriegsverluste unter Vertriebenen, Gefangenen und Verschleppter: mit einer übersicht über die europäischen Nachkriegsverluste (Munich and Berlin, 1988), pp. 36f.)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that 6000 German officers were sent from camps in the West to the Soviets, who put them in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] which at the time was one of the [[NKVD special camps|NKVD special camp]] and from which it is known that there were transfers further east to Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ex-Death Camp Tells Story Of Nazi and Soviet Horrors&quot; NYT, December 17, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[North Korea]]ns have a reputation for severely mistreating prisoners of war (see [[Korean War#Prisoners of war|Crimes against POWs]]). Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful in the army and thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Three&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kpows.com/thechineseconnection.html |title=Chinese operated three types of POW camps for Americans during the Korean War |date=April 1997 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the 1952 Inter-Camp P.O.W. Olympics were held during November 15 and 27, 1952, in Pyuktong, [[North Korea]]. The Chinese hoped to gain worldwide publicity and while some prisoners refused to participate some 500 P.O.W.s of eleven nationalities took part.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 2007, p. 62&quot;&gt;Adams, (2007), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; They were representative of all the prison camps in North Korea and competed in: football, [[baseball]], [[softball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], [[soccer]], [[gymnastics]], and [[boxing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams, 2007, p. 62&quot; /&gt; For the P.O.W.s this was also an opportunity to meet with friends from other camps. The prisoners had their own photographers, announcers, even reporters, who after each days competition published a newspaper, the &quot;Olympic Roundup&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Clarence. (2007).

Of about 16,500 French soldiers who fought at the [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] in [[French Indochina]], more than 3,000 were killed in battle, while almost all of the 11,721 men taken prisoner died in the hands of the [[Viet Minh]] on death marches to distant POW camps, and in those camps in the last three months of the war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''[http://books.google.cz/books?id=zCVrzwEErzgC&amp;pg=PA388&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Trap Door to the Dark Side]''&quot;.

The [[Vietcong]] and [[North Vietnamese]] captured many [[United States Armed Forces|United States service members]] as prisoners of war during the [[Vietnam War]], who suffered from mistreatment and torture during the war. Some American prisoners were held in the prison called the [[Hanoi Hilton]]. Communist Vietnamese held in custody by [[South Vietnam]]ese and American forces [[Côn Sơn Island#“Tiger cages”|were also tortured]] and badly treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;south-viet&quot;/&gt; After the war, millions of South Vietnamese servicemen and government workers were sent to [[Reeducation camp|&quot;re-education&quot; camps]] where many perished.

Like in previous conflicts, there has been speculation without evidence that there were a handful of American pilots captured by the North Koreans and the North Vietnamese who were transferred to the Soviet Union and were never repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1993-08-29/news/mn-29122_1_korean-war&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalalliance.org/korea/korea04.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taskforceomegainc.org/USSR.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of regulations determining treatment to prisoners, violations of their rights continue to be reported. Many cases of POW massacres have been reported in recent times, including [[October 13 massacre]] in [[Lebanon]] by Syrian forces and [[Massacre of police officers in Eastern Sri Lanka in June 1990|June 1990 massacre]] in [[Sri Lanka]].

During the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, American, British, Italian and Kuwaiti POWs (mostly crew members of downed aircraft and special forces) were tortured by the Iraqi secret police. An American military doctor, [[Rhonda Cornum|Major Rhonda Cornum]], a 37-year-old flight surgeon captured when her Blackhawk UH-60 was shot down, was also subjected to sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war story: Rhonda Cornum |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/war/5.html |date= |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s [[Yugoslav Wars]], [[Serb]] paramilitary forces supported by JNA forces killed POWs at [[Vukovar massacre|Vukovar]] and [[Škabrnja massacre|Škarbrnja]] while [[Bosnian Serb]] forces killed POWs at [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica]].

[[Image:PakistanPoW.jpg|right|frame|A Pakistan stamp depicting POWs in Indian camps after the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani War]]. The stamp was issued with the political aim of raising global awareness to help secure their release. The POWs were released after the [[Simla Agreement]].]]

In 2001, there were reports concerning two prisoners that India had taken during the [[Sino-Indian War]], Yang Chen and Shih Liang. The two were imprisoned as spies for three years before being interned in a [[mental asylum]] in [[Ranchi]], where they spent the next 38 years under a special prisoner status.&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh Azizur Rahman, &quot;[http://www.washtimes.com/world/20030727-104257-8893r.htm  Two Chinese prisoners from '62 war repatriated]&quot;, ''The Washington Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The last prisoners of [[Iran–Iraq War]] (1980–1988) were exchanged in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DEFDC113EF937A25750C0A9659C8B63 |title=&quot;THREATS AND RESPONSES: BRIEFLY NOTED; IRAN-IRAQ PRISONER DEAL&quot;, Nazila Fathi, '&amp;#39;New York Times'&amp;#39;, March 14, 2003 |publisher=New York Times |date=2003-03-14 |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers of POWs==
This is a list of nations with the highest number of POWs since the start of World War II, listed in descending order. These are also the highest numbers in any war since the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War]] entered into force on 19 June 1931. The USSR had not signed the Geneva convention.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Alan ''[[Operation Barbarossa|Barbarossa]]: The Russian-Geran Conflict 1941–1945'' p. 206, ISBN 0-304-35864-9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Privacy''' (from {{lang-la|[[privatus]]}} &quot;separated from the rest, deprived of something, esp. office, participation in the government&quot;, from ''privo'' &quot;to deprive&quot;) is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively. The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures and individuals, but share basic common themes. Privacy is sometimes related to [[anonymity]], the wish to remain unnoticed or unidentified in the public realm. When something is private to a ''person'', it usually means there is something within them that is considered inherently special or personally sensitive. The degree to which private information is exposed therefore depends on how the public will receive this information, which differs between places and over time. Privacy partially intersects [[security]], including for instance the concepts of appropriate use, as well as protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [[bodily integrity]].

The right not to be subjected to unsanctioned invasion of privacy by the [[government]], [[corporation]]s or [[individual]]s is part of many countries' [[#Privacy law|privacy laws]], and in some cases, [[constitution]]s. Almost all countries have laws which in some way limit privacy; an example of this would be law concerning [[taxation]], which normally require the sharing of  information about personal [[income]] or [[earnings]]. In some countries individual privacy may conflict with [[freedom of speech]] laws and some laws may require public disclosure of information which would be considered private in other countries and cultures.
Privacy may be [[Communication privacy management theory|voluntarily sacrificed]], normally in exchange for perceived benefits and very often with specific dangers and losses, although this is a very strategic view of human relationships. Academics who are economists, evolutionary theorists, and research psychologists describe revealing privacy as a 'voluntary sacrifice', for instance by willing participants in sweepstakes or competitions. In the business world, a person may volunteer personal details (often for [[advertising]] purposes) in order to gamble on winning a prize. Personal information which is voluntarily shared but subsequently stolen or misused can lead to [[identity theft]].

The concept of universal individual privacy is a modern construct associated with [[Western culture]], English and North American in particular, and remained virtually unknown in some cultures until recent times. According to some researchers, this concept sets [[United Kingdom–United States relations|Anglo-American]] culture apart even from Western European cultures such as French or Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zemskaya|first=E. A.|title=Особенности русской речи эмигрантов четвертой волны (Features of the Russian language of fourth wave immigrants)|url=http://www.gramota.ru/biblio/magazines/gramota/28_520|publisher=Gramota.ru|accessdate=24 February 2009|language=Russian|date=9 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cultures, however, recognize the ability of individuals to withhold certain parts of their personal information from wider society - a figleaf over the genitals being an ancient example.
The word &quot;privacy&quot; is an example of an [[Untranslatability|untranslatable]] [[lexeme]],&lt;ref name=&quot;TranslationToday&quot;/&gt; and many languages do not have a specific word for &quot;privacy&quot;. Such languages either use a complex description to translate the term (such as Russian combining the meaning of ''уединение'' - solitude, ''секретность'' - secrecy, and ''частная жизнь'' - private life) or borrow from English &quot;privacy&quot; (as Indonesian ''Privasi'' or Italian ''la privacy'').&lt;ref name=&quot;TranslationToday&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation Today: Trends and Perspectives |last=Anderman |first=Gunilla M. |coauthors=Rogers, Margaret |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hJxVffwZEDgC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73#v=onepage&amp;q=privacy&amp;f=false |publisher=Multilingual Matters |year=2003 |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of privacy==

The term &quot;privacy&quot; means many things in different contexts.  Different people, cultures, and nations have a wide variety of expectations about how much privacy a person is entitled to or what constitutes an [[invasion of privacy]].

===Personal privacy===

Most people have a strong sense of privacy in relation to the exposure of their body to others. This is an aspect of personal [[modesty]]. A person will go to extreme lengths to protect this personal modesty, the main way being the wearing of [[clothing|clothes]]. Other ways include erection of [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, screens, use of [[cathedral glass]], partitions, by maintaining a distance, beside other ways. People who go to those lengths expect that their privacy will be respected by others. At the same time, people are prepared to expose themselves in acts of [[physical intimacy]], but these are confined to exposure in circumstances and of persons of their choosing. Even a discussion of those circumstances is regarded as intrusive and typically unwelcome.

Physical privacy could be defined as preventing &quot;intrusions into one's physical space or solitude&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BwQBT2Mr1YoC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=physical+privacy&amp;sig=dvybgqk6wfkf_xGimY8lvtWVV3I Managing Privacy: Information Technology and Corporate America]
 By H. Jeff&lt;/ref&gt;
This would include such concerns as:
* preventing intimate acts or hiding one's body from others for the purpose of [[modesty]]; apart from being [[clothing|dressed]] this can be achieved by [[wall]]s, [[fence]]s, privacy screens, [[cathedral glass]], partitions between [[urinal (restroom)|urinals]], by being far away from others, on a bed by a [[bed sheet]] or a [[blanket]], when changing clothes by a [[towel]], etc.; to what extent these measures also prevent acts being ''heard'' varies
* video, of aptly named graphic, or intimate, acts, behaviors or body parts
* preventing unwelcome searching of one's personal possessions
* preventing unauthorized access to one's home or vehicle
* medical privacy, the right to make fundamental medical decisions without governmental coercion or third party review, most widely applied to questions of contraception

An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the US [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] which guarantees &quot;the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3805/is_200206/ai_n9109326/pg_1 | work=Georgetown Law Journal | title=Fixing the Fourth Amendment with trade secret law: A response to Kyllo v. United States | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most countries have laws regarding [[trespassing]] and property rights also determine the right of physical privacy.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness.  There may also be concerns about safety, if for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacyrights.org/fs/fs14a-stalking.htm |title=Security Recommendations For Stalking Victims |publisher=Privacyrights.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their privacy within a crowd.

===Informational===
{{Main|Information privacy}}

Information or data privacy refers to the evolving relationship between technology and the legal right to, or public expectation of, privacy in the collection and sharing of data about one's self.  Privacy concerns exist wherever uniquely identifiable data relating to a person or persons are collected and stored, in digital form or otherwise. In some cases these concerns refer to how data is collected, stored, and associated. In other cases the issue is who is given access to information. Other issues include whether an individual has any ownership rights to data about them, and/or the right to view, verify, and challenge that information.

Various types of personal information are often associated with privacy concerns. For various reasons, individuals may object to personal information such as their religion, sexual orientation, political affiliations, or personal activities being revealed, perhaps to avoid [[discrimination]], personal embarrassment, or damage to their professional reputations.

[[Financial privacy]], in which information about a person's financial transactions is guarded, is important for the avoidance of [[fraud]] including [[identity theft]]. Information about a person's purchases, for instance, can reveal a great deal about their preferences, places they have visited, their contacts, products (such as medications) they use, their activities and habits etc.

[[Internet privacy]] is the ability to determine what information one reveals or withholds about oneself over the Internet, who has access to such information, and for what purposes one's information may or may not be used.  For example, web users may be concerned to discover that many of the web sites which they visit collect, store, and possibly share [[personally identifiable information]] about them. Similarly, Internet email users generally consider their emails to be private and hence would be concerned if their [[email]] was being accessed, read, stored or forwarded by third parties without their consent. Tools used to protect privacy on the Internet include encryption tools and anonymizing services like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]].

[[Medical privacy]] allows a person to withhold their medical records and other information from others, perhaps because of fears that it might affect their insurance coverage or employment, or to avoid the embarrassment caused by revealing medical conditions or treatments. Medical information could also reveal other aspects of one's personal life, such as sexual preferences or proclivity.  A right to [[sexual privacy]] enables individuals to [[contraceptive security|acquire and use contraceptives]] without family, community or legal sanctions.

[[Political privacy]] has been a concern since [[voting system]]s emerged in ancient times. The [[secret ballot]] helps to ensure that voters cannot be coerced into voting in certain ways, since they can allocate their vote as they wish in the privacy and security of the voting booth while maintaining the anonymity of the vote. Secret ballots are nearly universal in modern [[democracy]], and considered a basic right of [[citizenship]], despite the difficulties that they cause (for example the inability to trace votes back to the corresponding voters increases the risk of someone stuffing additional fraudulent votes into the system: additional security controls are needed to minimize such risks).

===Organizational===

Governments agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various [[security]] practices and controls in order to prevent this.  Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets.  For example, a government administration may be able to invoke [[executive privilege]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.corporate.findlaw.com/amar/20040416.html |title=FindLaw's Writ - Amar: Executive Privilege |publisher=Writ.corporate.findlaw.com |date=2004-04-16 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or declares certain information to be [[Classified information|classified]], or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Spiritual and intellectual===

The earliest legislative development of privacy rights began under [[British common law]], which protected &quot;only the physical interference of life and property.&quot; Its development from then on became &quot;one of the most significant chapters in the history of privacy law.&quot;&lt;ref name=Solove&gt;Solove, Daniel J., Rotenberg, Marc, Schwartz, Paul M. ''Privacy, Information, and Technology'', Aspen Publ. (2006) pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Privacy rights gradually expanded to include a &quot;recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings and his intellect.&quot;&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt; Eventually, the scope of those rights broadened even further to include a basic &quot;right to be let alone,&quot; and the former definition of &quot;property&quot; would then comprise &quot;every form of possession -- intangible, as well as tangible.&quot; By the late 19th century, interest in a &quot;right to privacy&quot; grew as a response to the growth of print media, especially newspapers.&lt;ref name=Solove/&gt;

===Privacy and technology===
[[File:IllinoisTelephoneAndTelegraphAd.png|thumb|200px|Advertisement for dial telephone service available to delegates to the 1912 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] convention in [[Chicago]].  A major selling point of dial telephone service was that it was &quot;secret&quot;, in that no operator was required to connect the call.]]

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the [[printing press]] or the [[Internet]], the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed &lt;ref&gt;Information Privacy, Official Reference for the Certified Information privacy Professional (CIPP), Swire, P.P [http://www.amazon.com/s?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;search-type=ss&amp;index=books&amp;field-author=Peter%20P.%20Swire]. and Bermann, S. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; that the first publication advocating privacy in the [[United States]] was the article by [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel Warren]] and [[Louis Brandeis]], &quot;[[The Right to Privacy (article)|The Right to Privacy]]&quot;, [http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/privacy/Privacy_brand_warr2.html 4 Harvard L.R. 193 (1890)], that was written largely in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs2.com/privacy.htm |title=Privacy Law in the United States |publisher=Rbs2.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. For example, in the U.S. it was thought that heat sensors intended to be used to find marijuana growing operations would be acceptable. However in 2001 in [[Kyllo v. United States]] (533 U.S. 27) it was decided that the use of [[thermal imaging]] devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant does indeed constitute a violation of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/ |title=Privacy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally the increased ability to gather and send information has had negative implications for retaining privacy. As large scale [[information systems]] become more common, there is so much information stored in many databases worldwide that an individual has no practical means of knowing of or controlling all of the information about themselves that others may have hold or access. Such information could potentially be sold to others for profit and/or be used for purposes not known to or sanctioned by the individual concerned. The concept of [[information privacy]] has become more significant as more systems controlling more information appear. Also the consequences of privacy violations can be more severe.  [[Privacy law]] in many countries has had to adapt to changes in technology in order to address these issues and, to some extent, maintain privacy rights. But the existing global privacy rights framework has also been criticized as incoherent and inefficient.  Proposals such as the [[APEC]] Privacy Framework have emerged which set out to provide the first comprehensive legal framework on the issue of global data privacy.

In May 2013 Xbox One was announced with its updated sensor and this caused some concerns. Critics argue that the Xbox one kinect sensor is on at all times. Due to the requirement of updates every 24 hours,if the Xbox one is not connected to the internet for several days, a manual update is needed.&lt;ref name=XboxOneMay2013Mashable&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xbox-one-experts.com/xbox-one-kinect|title=Report:big brother?|publisher=xboxexperts|author=RL Waterman|date=2013-05-24|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xbox one can scan through clothes to gain information about your muscle tension and reflexes regardless of a bulky sweater you might be wearing, for a seamless gaming experience.&lt;ref name=XboxOneMay2013XboxExperts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mashable.com/2013/05/22/xbox-one-kinect-heartbeat/|title=Report:watchyourheartbeat|publisher=mashable|author=Lance Ulanoff|date=2013-05-23|accessdate=2013-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kinect sensor knows when you are smiling, crying, angry, or bored.

===Privacy and the Internet===
{{Main|Internet privacy}}

The Internet has brought new concerns about privacy in an age where computers can permanently store records of everything: &quot;where every online photo, status update, Twitter post and blog entry by and about us can be stored forever,&quot; writes law professor and author Jeffrey Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;Rosen, Jeffrey. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology &quot;The Web Means the End of Forgetting&quot;] ''New York Times'', July 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This currently has an effect on employment. Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; This has created a need by many to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, both of which have led to legal suits against various sites and employers.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. [[Facebook]] for example, as of July 2010, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 500 million members, or 22 percent of all Internet users, who upload over 25 billion pieces of content each month. [[Twitter]] has more than 100 million registered users. The [[Library of Congress]] recently announced that it will be acquiring — and permanently storing — the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006, reports Rosen.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt;

According to some experts, many commonly used communication devices may be mapping every move of their users. Senator [[Al Franken]] has noted the seriousness of [[iPhones]] and [[iPads]] having the ability to record and store users locations in unencrypted files,&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, Helen A.S., [http://technolog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/04/21/6508416-govt-officials-want-answers-to-secret-iphone-tracking  &quot;Gov't officials want answers to secret iPhone tracking&quot;] ''MSNBC'', &quot;Technology&quot;,  April 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although Apple denied doing so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216210/Apple_denies_tracking_iPhone_users_but_promises_changes?taxonomyId=84 &quot;Apple denies tracking iPhone users, but promises changes&quot;], ''Computerworld'', April 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Grove]], co-founder and former CEO of [[Intel Corporation]], offered his thoughts on internet privacy in an interview in 2000:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 &quot;What I've Learned: Andy Grove&quot;], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age. At the heart of the Internet culture is a force that wants to find out everything about you. And once it has found out everything about you and two hundred million others, that's a very valuable asset, and people will be tempted to trade and do commerce with that asset. This wasn't the information that people were thinking of when they called this the information age.}}

==&quot;Right to privacy&quot;==
{{main|Right to privacy}}

Privacy uses the theory of natural rights, and generally responds to new information and communication technologies. In North America, [[Samuel D. Warren (US attorney)|Samuel D. Warren]] and [[Louis D. Brandeis]] wrote that privacy is the &quot;right to be let alone&quot; (Warren &amp; Brandeis, 1890) focuses on protecting individuals.  This citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as [[yellow journalism]]. Warren and Brandeis declared that information which was previously hidden and private could now be &quot;shouted from the rooftops.&quot;&lt;ref name=Brandeis&gt;Warren and Brandeis, [http://www.law.louisville.edu/library/collections/brandeis/node/225 &quot;The Right To Privacy&quot;], 4 Harvard Law Review 193 (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy rights are inherently intertwined with information technology. In his widely cited [[dissenting opinion]] in ''[[Olmstead v. United States]]'' (1928), Brandeis relied on thoughts he developed in his [[Louis Brandeis#Creating a Right to Privacy|''Harvard Law Review'' article]] in 1890. But in his dissent, he now changed the focus whereby he urged making personal privacy matters more relevant to [[constitutional law]], going so far as saying &quot;the government [was] identified .... as a potential privacy invader.&quot; He writes, &quot;Discovery and invention have made it possible for the Government, by means far more effective than stretching upon the rack, to obtain disclosure in court of what is whispered in the closet.&quot; At that time, telephones were often community assets, with shared party lines and the potentially nosey human operators. By the time of Katz, in 1967, telephones had become personal devices with lines not shared across homes and switching was electro-mechanical. In the 1970s, new computing and recording technologies began to raise concerns about privacy, resulting in the [[Fair Information Practice Principles]].

===Definitions===

In recent years there have been only few attempts to clearly and precisely define a &quot;right to privacy.&quot; Some experts assert that in fact the right to privacy &quot;should not be defined as a separate legal right&quot; at all. By their reasoning, existing laws relating to privacy in general should be sufficient.&lt;ref name=Haifa&gt;Yael Onn, et. al., [http://books.google.com/books?id=yeVRrrJw-zAC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=right+to+privacy+tel+aviv&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=T0IhTaWhEI-msQOizMWZCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=right%20to%20privacy%20tel%20aviv&amp;f=false ''Privacy in the Digital Environment''] ,  Haifa Center of Law &amp; Technology, (2005) pp. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, such as [[William Prosser|Dean Prosser]], have attempted, but failed, to find a &quot;common ground&quot; between the leading kinds of privacy cases in the court system, at least to formulate a definition.&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt; One law school treatise from Israel, however, on the subject of &quot;privacy in the digital environment,&quot; suggests that the &quot;right to privacy should be seen as an independent right that deserves legal protection in itself.&quot; It has therefore proposed a working definition for a &quot;right to privacy&quot;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The right to privacy is our right to keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity. The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose.''&lt;ref name=Haifa/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===An individual &quot;right&quot;===

[[Alan Westin]] believes that new technologies alter the balance between privacy and disclosure, and that privacy rights may limit government surveillance to protect democratic processes.  Westin defines privacy as &quot;the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others&quot;.   Westin describes four states of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, reserve.  These states must balance participation against norms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Each individual is continually engaged in a personal adjustment process in which he balances the desire for privacy with the desire for disclosure and communication of himself to others, in light of the environmental conditions and social norms set by the society in which he lives.
- Alan Westin, Privacy and Freedom, 1968&lt;ref&gt;Westin, A. (1968). Privacy and freedom (Fifth ed.). New York, U.S.A.: Atheneum.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under liberal democratic systems, privacy creates a space separate from political life, and allows personal autonomy, while ensuring democratic [[Freedom of association|freedoms of association]] and [[Freedom of speech|expression]].

David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy.  He develops 'data protection' as an aspect of privacy, which involves &quot;the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information&quot;.  This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally.  Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, &quot;[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, D. (1989). Protecting privacy in surveillance societies: The federal republic of Germany, Sweden, France, Canada, and the United States. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control.  Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency.  For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any 'defect' in the 'product' that is not reported is fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Posner, R. A. (1981). The economics of privacy. The American Economic Review, 71(2), 405-409.&lt;/ref&gt; For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law.  Lessig claims &quot;the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right&quot;, and that &quot;individuals should be able to control information about themselves&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, L. (2006). Code: Version 2.0. New York, U.S.: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic approaches to privacy make communal conceptions of privacy difficult to maintain.

===A collective value and a human right===

There have been attempts to reframe privacy as a fundamental [[Human rights|human right]], whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Deborah|title=Ethical theory and business.|year=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0136126022|pages=428–442|edition=8th ed.|authorlink=Privacy|editor=Beauchamp, Bowie, Arnold}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Amitai Etzioni]] suggests a [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] approach to privacy.  This requires a shared moral culture for establishing social order.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2006). Communitarianism. In B. S. Turner (Ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Sociology (pp. 81-83). Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Etzioni believes that &quot;[p]rivacy is merely one good among many others&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2007). Are new technologies the enemy of privacy? Knowledge, Technology &amp; Policy, 20, 115-119.&lt;/ref&gt; and that technological effects depend on community accountability and oversight (ibid).  He claims that privacy laws only increase government surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (2000). A communitarian perspective on privacy. Connecticut Law Review, 32(3), 897-905.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy.  She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and [[Collectivism|collective]] components.  Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought.  Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power.  Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided.  Regan's goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: &quot;if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, P. M. (1995). Legislating privacy: Technology, social values, and public policy. Chapel Hill, U.S.: The University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy.  Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context.  The human right to privacy has precedent in the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]]: &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. (1948). Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Retrieved October 7, 2006 from http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;Shade, L. R. (2008). Reconsidering the right to privacy in Canada. Bulletin of Science, Technology &amp; Society, 28(1), 80-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privacy protection==

===Free market versus consumer protection approaches===

Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market, and consumer protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;quinn&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Ethics for the Information Age  | author=Quinn, Michael J.  | year=2009  | isbn=0-321-53685-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a free market approach, commercial entities are largely allowed to do what they wish, with the expectation that consumers will choose to do business with corporations that respect their privacy to a desired degree. If some companies are not sufficiently respectful of privacy, they will lose market share.  Such an approach may be limited by lack of competition in a market, by enterprises not offering privacy options favorable to the user, or by lack of information about actual privacy practices.  Claims of privacy protection made by companies may be difficult for consumers to verify, except when they have already been violated.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is acknowledged that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available.  In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jensen&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title= Privacy policies as decision-making tools: an evaluation of online privacy notices | author=Jensen, Carlos | year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this approach advocates greater government definition and enforcement of privacy standards.

===Privacy law===
{{Main|Privacy law}}

Privacy law is the area of law concerning the protecting and preserving of privacy rights of individuals.  While there is no universally accepted privacy law among all countries, some organizations promote certain concepts be enforced by individual countries.  For example, the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], article 12, states:

:''No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.''

;Europe
For [[Europe]], Article 8 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] guarantees the right to respect for private and family life, one's home and correspondence. The [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] has developed a large body of jurisprudence defining this fundamental right to privacy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} The [[European Union]] requires all member states to legislate to ensure that citizens have a right to privacy, through directives such as the 1995 [[Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data]]. It is regulated in the [[United Kingdom]] by the [[Data Protection Act 1998]]  and in France [[data protection]] is also monitored by the [[CNIL]], a governmental body which must authorize legislation concerning privacy before them being enacted. In civil law jurisdictions, the right to privacy fell within the ambit of the right to a private life (droit a la vie privee) from which the tort could be claimed. Personality rights and the broader tort based interpretation of the right to privacy protected correspondence, personal information and dignity. These rights gave rise to causes for damages in most civil law jurisdictions and common law jurisdictions prior to the sui generis development of Data Protection.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection, Some studies show that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws.&lt;ref&gt;Burghardt, Buchmann, Böhm, Kühling, Sivridis''A Study on the Lack of Enforcement of Data Protection Acts'' Proceedings of the 3rd int. conference on e-democracy, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United Kingdom
In the [[United Kingdom]], it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another [[tort]] (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4482073.stm Does Beckham judgment change rules?], from [[BBC News]] (retrieved 27 April 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
There is, however, the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: [[Data Protection Act 1998]]; [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]]; [[Environmental Information Regulations 2004]]; [[Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003|Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003]]. The ICO has also provided a &quot;Personal Information Toolkit&quot; online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ico.gov.uk/upload/documents/library/data_protection/practical_application/toolkit.pdf &quot;Personal Information Toolkit&quot;] prepared by the Information Commissioner’s Office, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States
Concerning [[privacy laws of the United States]], privacy is not guaranteed per se by the [[Constitution of the United States]].  The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has found that other guarantees have &quot;penumbras&quot; that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in ''[[Griswold v. Connecticut]]'' (1965). In the United States, the right of [[freedom of speech]] granted in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the U.S. by the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], and various state laws. Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]] (COPPA),&lt;ref&gt;Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 6501 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] (GLB), and the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA).

;Canada
[[Canadian privacy law]] is governed federally by multiple acts, including the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], and the [[Privacy Act (Canada)]].  Mostly this legislation concerns privacy infringement by government organizations.  [[Data privacy]] was first addressed  with the [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]], and provincial-level legislation also exists to account for more specific cases personal privacy protection against commercial organizations.

;Australia
In [[Australia]] there is the [[Privacy Act 1988]]. Privacy sector provisions of the Act apply to private sector organisations with a link to Australia, including:
1. individuals who collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of a business. For example, a sole trader's business activities will be regulated (unless it's a small business), but information gathered outside business activities won't be;
2. bodies corporate; and
3. partnerships, unincorporated associations and trusts - any act or practice of a partner, committee member or trustee is attributed to the organisation.
Organisations outside Australia must comply with the provisions in some circumstances. Sending information out of Australia is also regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privacy.gov.au/law/act |title=Privacy Act |publisher=Privacy.gov.au |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many means to protect one's privacy on the internet.
For example e-mails can be encrypted&lt;ref&gt;Eudora 3.05 was released with [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] built in, and then quickly followed by 3.06 without PGP.[http://www.pcworld.com/article/22902/eudora_light_305.html Eudora Light 3.0.5]&lt;/ref&gt; and anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like [[I2P]] and [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] can be used to prevent the internet service providers from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates. Covert collection of personally identifiable information has been identified as a primary concern by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;FederalTrade&quot;&gt;Federal Trade Commission (2010), &quot;Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: A Proposed Framework for Businesses and Policymakers,&quot; Preliminary FTC Staff Report (December), available at [http://www.ftc.gov/os/2010/12/101201privacyreport.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some privacy advocates recommend the deletion of original and third-party [[HTTP cookies]], Anthony Miyazaki, marketing professor at [[Florida International University]] and privacy scholar, warns that the &quot;elimination of third-party cookie use by Web sites can be circumvented by cooperative strategies with third parties in which information is transferred after the Web site's use of original domain cookies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miyazaki, Anthony D. (2008), &quot;Online Privacy and the Disclosure of Cookie Use: Effects on Consumer Trust and Anticipated Patronage,&quot; ''Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing'', 23 (Spring), 19–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2010, the Federal Trade Commission is reviewing policy regarding this issue as it relates to [[behavioral advertising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FederalTrade&quot; /&gt;
Another aspect of privacy on the Internet relates to online social networking. Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. A review and evalutation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals' privacy of online social networking show the following results: &quot;first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hugl, Ulrike (2011), &quot;Reviewing Person’s Value of Privacy of Online Social Networking,&quot; ''Internet Research'', 21(4), in press, http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?issn=1066-2243&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=4&amp;articleid=1926600&amp;show=abstract.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and location-based services===

As location tracking capabilities of mobile devices are increasing, problems related to user privacy arise, since user's position
and preferences constitute personal information and improper use of them violates user's privacy. A recent MIT study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|coauthors=César A. Hidalgo, Michel Verleysen, Vincent D. Blondel|title=Unique in the Crowd: The privacy bounds of human mobility|journal=Nature srep.|date=March 25|year=2013|month=03|doi=10.1038/srep01376|url=http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130325/srep01376/full/srep01376.html|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Palmer|first=Jason|title=Mobile location data 'present anonymity risk'|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-21923360|accessdate=12 April 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity.

Several methods to protect user's privacy when using location based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers, blurring of information e.a. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to be able to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of providing accurate location information and the drawbacks of risking personal privacy.&lt;ref&gt;Athanasios S. Voulodimos and Charalampos Z. Patrikakis, &quot;Quantifying Privacy in Terms of Entropy for Context Aware Services&quot;, special issue of the Identity in the Information Society journal, &quot;Identity Management in Grid and SOA&quot;, Springer, vol. 2, no 2, December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Users of such services may also choose to display more generic location information (i.e. &quot;In the City&quot; or &quot;Philadelphia&quot; or &quot;Work&quot;) to some of their more casual acquaintances while only displaying specific location information, such as their exact address, to closer contacts like spouse, relatives, and good friends.

In recent years, seen with the increasing importance of mobile devices and pared with the ''[[National Do Not Call Registry]]'', telemarketers have turned attention to mobiles.&lt;ref name = &quot;Telemarketers and Mobiles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sneaky-tactics-used-by-telemarketers-and-debt-collectors-to-get-your-cell-phone-number-2011-6 |title=Sneaky tactics used by telemarketers and debt collectors to get your cell phone number |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of telemarketers to use mobile devices have been met with both ''[[Federal Trade Commission]]'' and companies like PrivacyStar. Each year, thousands of complaints are filed to the FTC database with the help of companies and consumers.

=== Privacy by design ===

The principle of [[privacy by design]] states that privacy and [[data protection]] are embedded throughout the entire life cycle of [[technologies]], from the early [[design]] stage to their deployment, use and ultimate disposal.

=== Privacy self-synchronization ===

Privacy self-synchronization is the mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program's maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Popa, C., et. all., &quot;Managing Personal Information: Insights on Corporate Risk and Opportunity for Privacy-Savvy Leaders&quot;, Carswell (2012), Ch.6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FusionintheSun.svg|thumb|250px| The proton–proton chain reaction dominates in stars the size of the Sun or smaller.]]

The '''proton–proton chain reaction''' is one of several [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions by which [[star]]s convert [[hydrogen]] to [[helium]], the primary alternative being the [[CNO cycle]]. The proton–proton chain dominates in stars the size of the [[Sun]] or smaller.

In general, proton–proton fusion can occur only if the [[temperature]] (i.e. [[kinetic energy]]) of the protons is high enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic or [[Coulomb repulsion]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], ''The Nucleus'', '''1''':42,59, (1971), The Proton type-nuclear fission reaction&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sun, [[deuterium]]-producing events are so rare ([[diproton]]s, the much more common result of nuclear reactions within the star, immediately decay back into two protons) that a complete conversion of the star's hydrogen would take more than {{val|e=10}} (ten billion) years at the prevailing conditions of its core.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth S. Krane, ''Introductory Nuclear Physics'' , Wiley , 1987, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the Sun is still shining is due to the slow nature of this reaction; if it went more quickly, the Sun would have exhausted its hydrogen long ago.

==History of the proton–proton chain reaction==

The theory that proton–proton reactions were the basic principle by which the Sun and other stars burn was advocated by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]] in the 1920s. At the time, the temperature of the Sun was considered too low to overcome the [[Coulomb barrier]]. After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], it was discovered that [[Quantum tunnelling|tunneling]] of the [[wavefunction]]s of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature than the [[classical physics|classical]] prediction.

Even so, it was unclear how proton–proton fusion might proceed, because the most obvious product, helium-2 ([[diproton]]), is unstable and immediately dissociates back into a pair of protons. In 1939, [[Hans Bethe]] proposed that one of the protons could [[beta decay]] into a [[neutron]] via the [[weak interaction]] during the brief moment of fusion, making [[deuterium]] the initial product in the chain.&lt;ref&gt;Hans A. Bethe, ''Physical Review'' '''55''':103, 434 (1939); cited in Donald D. Clayton, ''Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis'', The University of Chicago Press, 1983, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was part of the body of work in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] for which Bethe won the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

==The proton–proton chain reaction==
The first step involves the fusion of two {{SimpleNuclide|Link|Hydrogen}} nuclei ([[proton]]s) into [[deuterium]], releasing a [[positron]] and a [[neutrino]] as one proton changes into a [[neutron]].  It is a two-stage process; first, two protons fuse to form a [[diproton]]:
:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:2em;&quot;
|{{Nuclide|Link|hydrogen|1}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{Nuclide|Link|hydrogen|1}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{Nuclide|Link|helium|2}}
|}
followed by the [[positron emission|beta-plus decay]] of the diproton to deuterium:
:{| border=&quot;0&quot;
|- style=&quot;height:2em;&quot;
|{{Nuclide|Link|helium|2}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||{{Nuclide|Link|deuterium|2}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron Neutrino}}
|}
with the overall formula:
&lt;!-- Autogenerated using Phykiformulae 0.11 by [[User:SkyLined]]
H + H -&gt; D + e- + ve + 1.42MeV
--&gt;:{| border=&quot;0&quot;

|}

This first step is extremely slow, because the [[Positron emission|beta-plus decay]] of the diproton to deuterium is extremely rare (the vast majority of the time, it decays back into hydrogen-1 through [[proton emission]]).

The positron immediately [[Electron–positron annihilation|annihilates]] with an [[electron]], and their mass energy, as well as their kinetic energy, is carried off by two [[gamma ray]] [[photon]]s.

e- + e+ -&gt; 2y + 1.02MeV

|{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Positron}}&amp;nbsp;||→&amp;nbsp;||2&amp;nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Gamma}}&amp;nbsp;||+&amp;nbsp;||{{val|1.02|u=MeV}}
|}

After this, the deuterium produced in the first stage can fuse with another proton to produce a light [[isotope]] of [[helium]], {{SimpleNuclide|Link|Helium|3}}:

|}

From here there are four possible paths to generate the helium isotope {{SimpleNuclide|Link|Helium|4}}. In pp I helium-4 comes from fusing two of the helium-3 nuclei produced; the pp II and pp III branches fuse {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}} with a pre-existing {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|4}} to make [[beryllium]]. In the Sun, branch pp I takes place with a frequency of 86%, pp II with 14% and pp III with 0.11%. There is also an extremely rare pp IV branch.  Additionally, other even less frequent reactions may occur; however, the rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or because the number of reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant.  This is partly why no mass-5 or mass-8 elements are seen.  The reactions that would produce them, such as a proton + helium-4 producing lithium-5, or two helium-4 nuclei coming together to form beryllium-8, while they may ''actually'' happen, do not show up because there are no stable isotopes of mass 5 or 8; the resulting products immediately decay into their initial reactants.'''

The pp II branch is dominant at temperatures of 14 to {{val|23|u=MK}}.

90% of the neutrinos produced in the reaction {{SimpleNuclide|Beryllium|7}}({{SubatomicParticle|Electron}},{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}){{SimpleNuclide|Lithium|7}}* carry an energy of {{val|0.861|u=MeV}}, while the remaining 10% carry {{val|0.383|u=MeV}} (depending on whether lithium-7 is in the ground state or an excited state, respectively).

|}

The pp III chain is dominant if the temperature exceeds {{val|23|u=MK}}.

The pp III chain is not a major source of energy in the Sun (only 0.11%), but was very important in the [[solar neutrino problem]] because it generates very high energy neutrinos (up to {{val|14.06|u=MeV}}).

=== The pp IV (Hep) branch===
This reaction is predicted but has never been observed due to its great rarity (about {{val|0.3|ul=ppm}} in the Sun). In this reaction, Helium-3 reacts directly with a proton to give helium-4, with an even higher possible neutrino energy (up to 18.8 MeV).

|}

=== Energy release ===
Comparing the mass of the final helium-4 atom with the masses of the four protons reveals that 0.007 or 0.7% of the mass of the original protons has been lost. This mass has been converted into energy, in the form of gamma rays and neutrinos released during each of the individual reactions. The total energy yield of one whole chain is {{val|26.73|u=MeV}}.

Energy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of two protons and He4 from pp-I reaction) increases the temperature of plasma in the Sun. This heating supports the Sun and prevents it from collapsing under its own weight. 

Neutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and do not help support the Sun against gravitational collapse. The neutrinos in the ppI, ppII and ppIII chains carry away 2.0%, 4.0%, and 28.3% of the energy in those reactions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Claus E. Rolfs and William S. Rodney, ''Cauldrons in the Cosmos'', The University of Chicago Press, 1988, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sun, the frequency ratio of the pep reaction versus the pp reaction is 1:400. However, the neutrinos released by the pep reaction are far more energetic: while neutrinos produced in the first step of the pp reaction range in energy up to {{val|0.42|u=MeV}}, the pep reaction produces sharp-energy-line neutrinos of {{val|1.44|u=MeV}}. Detection of solar neutrinos from this reaction were reported by the [[Borexino]] collaboration in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;First Evidence of pep Solar Neutrinos by Direct Detection in Borexino&quot; (preprint on arXiv): Phys. Rev. Lett. '''108''',  (5), 051302 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the pep and pp reactions can be seen as two different [[Feynman diagram|Feynman]] representations of the same basic interaction, where the electron passes to the right side of the reaction as an anti-electron. This is represented in the figure of proton–proton and electron-capture chain reactions in a star, available at the NDM'06 web site.&lt;ref&gt;Int'l Conference on Neutrino and Dark Matter, Thursday 07 Sept 2006, http://indico.lal.in2p3.fr/getFile.py/access?contribId=s16t1&amp;sessionId=s16&amp;resId=1&amp;materialId=0&amp;confId=a05162 Session 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plankton''' (singular '''plankter''') are any [[organism]]s that live in the [[water column]] and are incapable of swimming against a current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

These organisms include drifting [[animal]]s, [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], [[algae]], or [[bacteria]] that inhabit the [[pelagic zone]] of [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s, or bodies of [[fresh water]].  That is, plankton are defined by their [[ecological niche]] rather than [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] or [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] classification. 

Though many '''planktic''' (or '''planktonic'''&amp;mdash;see the next section below) [[species]] are [[microscope|microscopic]] in size, ''plankton'' includes organisms covering a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as [[jellyfish]].

== Terminology ==
[[File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|left|Some marine [[diatom]]s - a key [[phytoplankton]] group|alt=Photo of mostly transparent diatoms of varying shapes: one resembles a bagel, another a short length of tape, others look like tiny kayaks]]The name '''plankton''' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] adjective ''πλαγκτός - planktos'', meaning &quot;errant&quot;, and by extension &quot;wanderer&quot; or &quot;drifter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last = Thurman

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plankton typically flow with ocean currents. While some forms are capable of independent movement and can swim hundreds of meters vertically in a single day (a behavior called [[diel vertical migration]]), their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding [[ocean current|currents]]. This is in contrast to '''[[nekton]]''' organisms that can swim against the ambient flow and control their position (e.g. [[squid]], [[fish]], and [[marine mammal]]s).   
   
Within the plankton, '''[[holoplankton]]''' spend their entire [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] as plankton (e.g. most [[algae]], [[copepod]]s, [[salp]]s, and some [[jellyfish]]). By contrast, '''[[meroplankton]]''' are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the [[larva]]l stage), and then graduate to either a nektic or [[benthos|benthic]] (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of [[sea urchin]]s, [[starfish]], [[crustacean]]s, marine [[worm]]s, and most [[fish]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}.   

Plankton abundance and distribution are strongly dependent on factors such as ambient [[nutrient]] concentrations, the physical state of the water column, and the abundance of other plankton.
   
The study of plankton is termed [[planktology]] and a planktonic individual is referred to as a plankter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/463117/plankter Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjective '''planktonic''' is widely used in both the scientific and popular literature, and is a generally accepted term. However, from the standpoint of formal grammar the less commonly used '''planktic''' is more strictly the correct adjective. When deriving English words from their Greek or Latin roots the gender specific ending (in this case &quot;-on,&quot; which indicates the word is neuter) is normally dropped, using only the root of the word in the derivation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emiliani, C.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Emiliani | first=C. | year=1991 | title=Planktic/Planktonic, Nektic/Nektonic, Benthic/Benthonic | journal=Journal of Paleontology | volume=65 | pages=329 | jstor=1305769 | issue=2 | publisher=Journal of Paleontology, Vol. 65, No. 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trophic groups ==
[[File:hyperia.jpg|thumb|An [[amphipoda|amphipod]] (''Hyperia macrocephala'')|alt=Photo of mostly-translucent, many-legged, bug-like creature]]Plankton are primarily divided into broad functional (or [[trophic level]]) groups:   
* '''[[Phytoplankton]]''' (from Greek ''phyton'', or plant), [[autotroph]]ic, [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[alga]]e that live near the water surface where there is sufficient [[light]] to support [[photosynthesis]]. Among the more important groups are the [[diatom]]s, [[cyanobacteria]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[coccolithophore]]s.
* '''[[Zooplankton]]''' (from Greek ''zoon'', or animal), small [[protozoa]]ns or [[metazoa]]ns (e.g. [[crustacean]]s and other [[animal]]s) that feed on other plankton and [[telonemia]]. Some of the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and [[larva]]e of larger animals, such as fish, crustaceans, and [[annelid]]s, are included here.
* '''[[Bacterioplankton]]''', [[bacterium|bacteria]] and [[archaea]], which play an important role in [[remineralisation|remineralising]] organic material down the water column (note that the prokaryotic phytoplankton are also bacterioplankton).
   
This scheme divides the plankton community into broad '''producer''', '''consumer''' and '''recycler''' groups. However, determining the trophic level of some plankton is not straightforward. For example, although most [[dinoflagellates]] are either [[photosynthetic]] producers or [[heterotrophic]] consumers, many species are [[mixotrophic]] depending upon circumstances.

== Size groups ==
Plankton are also often described in terms of size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/center&gt;
   
However, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end of the scale.
The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity.  

The microplankton and smaller groups are [[microorganism]]s and operate at low [[Reynolds number]]s, where the viscosity of water is much more important than its mass or inertia.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dusenbery, David B. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Living at micro scale: the unexpected physics of being small |edition= |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2009 |pages= |isbn=0-674-03116-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution ==
[[File:World plankton prevailence.PNG|thumb|400px|right|thumb|World distribution of plankton]]
Plankton inhabit oceans, seas, lakes, ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see [[chemosynthesis]]), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.

A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the [[tropics|tropical]] and [[sub-tropical]] oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]] and [[silicate]]. This results from large-scale [[ocean current|ocean circulation]] and water column [[Stratification (water)|stratification]]. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).   

Despite significant [[macronutrient]] concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called [[HNLC|HNLC regions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface.  Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, [[arid]] land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]], where [[trade winds]] bring dust from the [[Sahara Desert]] in north [[Africa]]). While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, [[zooplankton]] and [[bacterioplankton]] instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called [[marine snow]], can be especially high following the termination of [[spring bloom]]s.

== Biogeochemical significance ==
Aside from representing the bottom few levels of a [[food chain]] that supports [[Commerce|commercially]] important [[Fishery|fisheries]], plankton [[ecosystem]]s play a role in the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of many important [[chemical element]]s, including the ocean's [[carbon cycle]].   

Primarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton  provide carbon to the planktic foodweb, either [[Cellular respiration|respiring]] it to provide [[metabolism|metabolic]] energy, or upon death as [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] or [[detritus]]. Organic Material tends to be more [[density|dense]] than [[seawater]] and as a result it sinks into open ocean ecosystems away from the coastlines transporting carbon  along with it. This process is known as the '''[[biological pump]]''', and it is one reason that oceans constitute the largest [[carbon sink]] on [[Earth science|Earth]].

It might be possible to increase the ocean's uptake of [[Carbon dioxide#In the Earth.27s atmosphere|carbon dioxide]] generated through [[anthropogenic|human activities]] by increasing  plankton production through &quot;[[Iron fertilization|seeding]]&quot;, primarily with the [[micronutrient]] [[iron]]. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean [[Anoxic sea water|oxygen depletion]] and resultant [[methanogen|methane production]] (caused by the excess production [[remineralisation|remineralising]] at depth) is one potential drawback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Biomass variability===
The growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability.  The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world's oceans.  On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres.  Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels.  For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during [[El Nino]] periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and [[marine mammal]]s.

The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research.  Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Steinacher, M., et al. (2010), Projected 21st century decrease in marine productivity: a multi-model analysis, Biogeosciences, 7, 979-1005&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.

Freshly hatched fish larvae are also plankton for a few days as long as they cannot swim against currents.

== Importance to fish ==
Zooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all [[fish larva]]e as they switch from their [[yolk]] sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve.  Natural factors (e.g., current variations) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams) can strongly affect zooplankton, which can in turn strongly affect larval survival, and therefore breeding success.

'''Pi Day''' is  an annual celebration commemorating the [[mathematical constant]] [[pi|{{pi}} (pi)]]. Pi Day is observed on March 14 (or 3/14 in the ''month/day'' [[Calendar_date#Date_format|date format]]), since 3, 1, and 4 are the three most [[Significant figures|significant digits]] of π in the decimal form. In 2009, the [[United States]] [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] supported the designation of Pi Day.&lt;ref name=HORRes&gt;United States. Cong. House.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Pauli effect''' is a term referring to the apparently mysterious 'anecdotal' failure of technical equipment in the presence of certain people. The term was coined using the name of the [[Austria]]n theoretical physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. The Pauli effect is not to be confused with the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which is a [[good faith|bona fide]] physical phenomenon.

==History==
Since the 20th century, the work of [[physics]] research has been divided between theorists and experimentalists (see [[scientific method]]). Only a few physicists, such as [[Enrico Fermi]], have been successful in both roles. Lacking an aptitude or interest in experimental work, many theorists have earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment. Pauli was exceptional in this regard: it was said that he was such a good theorist that any experiments would self-destruct simply because he was in the vicinity. For fear of the Pauli effect, the experimental physicist [[Otto Stern]] banned Pauli from his laboratory in [[Hamburg]] despite their friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Enz (2009), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident occurred in the physics laboratory at the [[University of Göttingen]]. An expensive measuring device, for no apparent reason, suddenly stopped working, although Pauli was in fact ''absent''. [[James Franck]], the director of the institute reported the incident to his colleague Pauli in Zürich with the humorous remark that at least this time Pauli was innocent. However, it turned out that Pauli on a railway journey to Copenhagen switched trains in Göttingen rail station about the time of failure. The incident is reported in [[George Gamow]]'s book, ''Thirty Years That Shook Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;Thirty Years That Shook Physics: The Story of Quantum Theory, 1966, Dover Publications, ISBN 0-486-24895-X.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is also claimed the more talented the theoretical physicist, the stronger the effect.

R. Peierls describes a case when at one reception this effect was to be parodied by deliberately crashing a chandelier upon Pauli's entrance. The chandelier was suspended on a rope to be released, but it stuck instead, thus becoming a real example of the Pauli effect! &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peierls, R. |title=Wolfgang Ernst Pauli, 1900-1958 |journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society | volume=5 |issue= |page= |year=1960 |doi=10.1098/rsbm.1960.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauli effect, if it were [[reality|real]], would be classified as a &quot;macro-[[psychokinesis|psychokinetic]]&quot; phenomenon. Pauli was convinced that the effect named after him was real.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enz2002-150&quot;&gt;Enz (2002), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As Pauli considered [[parapsychology]] worthy of serious investigation, this would fit with his thinking; to this end, Pauli corresponded with [[Hans Bender]] and [[Carl Jung]] on the concept of [[Synchronicity]]. In 1934, Pauli saw a failure of his car during a honeymoon tour with his second wife as proof of a ''real Pauli effect'' since it occurred without an obvious external cause.&lt;ref&gt;Wissenschaftlicher Briefwechsel mit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg u. a, Band 3 von Wolfgang Pauli, Karl von Meyenn, Herausgeber Karl von Meyenn, Verlag Birkhäuser, 1993, ISBN 0-387-54911-0, P. 763&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1950, when he was at [[Princeton University]], the [[cyclotron]] burnt, and he asked himself if this mischief belonged to such a Pauli effect, named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Wissenschaftlicher Briefwechsel mit Bohr, Einstein, Heisenberg, u.a. |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |first=Wolfgang |last=Pauli |coauthors=et al. |others=ed. Karl von Meyenn |year=1996 |volume=vol. 4/I |pages=37 |isbn=3-540-59442-6 |oclc=36847539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pauli effect at the foundation of the [[C.G. Jung Institute]], Zürich 1948, caused Pauli to write his article &quot;Background-Physics&quot;, in which he tries to find complementary relationships between physics and [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;meier2001-179&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Atom and Archetype: the Pauli/Jung Letters, 1932-1958 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=[[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] |author=Pauli, Wolfgang; [[Carl Jung|Jung, C G]] |others=ed. C.A. Meier |year=2001 |pages=179–196 |isbn=0-691-01207-5 |oclc=45757717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel-prize-winning theoretical physicist Richard Feynman, when a young graduate student at Princeton, conducted an experiment in the university's [[cyclotron]] laboratory that seemingly exhibited the &quot;Pauli effect&quot;. The experiment ended with the explosion of a [[carboy]] (a large glass container). Feynman wrote, &quot;I'll always remember how the great Professor Del Sasso, who was in charge of the cyclotron, came over to me and said sternly, &quot;The freshman experiments should be done in the freshman laboratory!&quot; [http://buffman.net/ebooks/Richard_P_Feynman-Surely_Youre_Joking_Mr_Feynman_v5.pdf ''Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!'']

'''Pat Mills''' is a British [[comics]] writer and editor who, along with [[John Wagner]], revitalised British boys comics in the 1970s, and has remained a leading light in [[British comics]] ever since. He has been called &quot;the godfather of British comics&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Molcher, M: &quot;Pat Mills - the Guv'nor&quot;, ''Judge Dredd Megazine'', #261&lt;/ref&gt;

His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism. He is best known for creating ''[[2000 AD (comic)|2000 AD]]'' and playing a major part in the development of ''[[Judge Dredd]]''.

==Biography==

Mills started his career as a sub-editor for [[D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd]], where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go [[freelance]], and were soon writing scripts for [[IPC Media|IPC]]'s girls' and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched ''[[Warlord (comic)|Warlord]]'', a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls' comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys' department, Mills, along with Wagner and [[Gerry Finley-Day]], worked in secret to create ''[[Battle Picture Weekly]]''. ''Battle'''s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC's traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated [[First World War]] series ''[[Charley's War]]'', drawn by [[Joe Colquhoun]], for the title.

After launching ''Battle'', Mills began developing a new boys' title, ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', launched in 1976. ''Action'''s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than two years before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into ''Battle''.

His next creation was the [[science fiction]]-themed weekly ''2000 AD'', launched in 1977. As with ''Battle'' and ''Action'' he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of ''Judge Dredd'' when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.

In 1978 IPC launched ''[[Starlord]]'', a short-lived companion title for ''2000 AD''. Mills contributed ''[[Ro-Busters]]'', a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to ''2000 AD'' when ''Starlord'' was cancelled.  ''Ro-Busters'' was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for ''2000 AD'', including ''[[ABC Warriors]]'' and ''[[Nemesis the Warlock]]''. Artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] was involved in the creation of all three. ''Nemesis'' in particular, featuring a morally ambiguous alien hero fighting a despotic human empire, allowed Mills to work out his feelings towards religion and imperialism. Another strand of his ''2000 AD'' work was ''[[Sláine (comics)|Sláine]]'', a [[barbarian]] [[fantasy]] based on [[Celtic mythology]] and [[neo-paganism]], which he co-created with his then wife [[Angela Kincaid]] (with whom he also created the children's series of books, ''[[The Butterfly Children]]'').

Mills also had a hand in IPC's line of Horror comics aimed at girls such as ''[[Chiller (comics)|Chiller]]''.

He has had little success in American comics, with the exception of [[Marshal Law]], a savage [[superhero]] satire published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Epic Comics|Epic]] imprint in the late 1980s, drawn by O'Neill.

In 1986 he edited the short-lived comic ''[[Dice Man (comics)|Dice Man]]'', which featured characters from ''2000 AD''. He wrote nearly every story.

In 1988 he was involved in the launch of ''[[Crisis (comic)|Crisis]]'', a politically aware ''2000 AD'' spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote ''[[Third World War (comics)|Third World War]]'', drawn initially by [[Carlos Ezquerra]], a polemical critique of global capitalism and the ways it exploits the developing world. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as [[Garth Ennis]], [[John Smith (comics)|John Smith]] and [[Sean Phillips]].

In 1991 Mills launched ''[[Toxic!]]'', an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy ''Crisis'', and a [[creator ownership|creator-owned]] ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer [[Tony Skinner]], including ''[[Accident Man]]'', an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. ''Toxic!'' lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as [[Duke Mighten]] and [[Martin Emond]].

In 1995, he broke in the French market, one of his life's goals, with ''Sha'', created with French artist [[Olivier Ledroit]].

He continues to write ''Sláine'', ''[[Bill Savage]]'', ''Black Siddha'' and ''ABC Warriors'' for ''2000 AD'', and also the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic]] ''[[Requiem Chevalier Vampire|Requiem Vampire Knight]]'', with art by [[Olivier Ledroit]] and its spin-off [[Claudia Chevalier Vampire]], with art by [[Franck Tacito]].

Two new series, ''[[Greysuit]]'', a super-powered government agent drawn by [[John Higgins (comics)|John Higgins]], and ''[[Defoe (comics)|Defoe]]'', a 17th century zombie hunter drawn by [[Leigh Gallagher]], began in ''2000 AD'' prog 1540.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000adonline.com/?zone=news&amp;page=newsimage&amp;choice=2kjun07 2000AD Online - news zone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mills has formed [[Repeat Offenders]] with artist [[Clint Langley]] and Jeremy Davis &quot;to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential&quot; and the first project is a graphic novel called ''[[American Reaper]]'', serialised in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' (#316-ongoing as of October 2011). It has been optioned by [[Trudie Styler]]'s [[Xingu Films]] and Mills has written the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3id4bf6e72d9d5fd611863364092cf7401 Grim 'Reaper' lands at Xingu], ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'', July 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also written two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Radio drama|audio plays]], &quot;[[Dead London]]&quot; (2008) and &quot;[[The Scapegoat (Doctor Who audio)|The Scapegoat]]&quot; (2009) for [[Big Finish Productions]], featuring the [[Eighth Doctor]] and [[Lucie Miller]]. The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish#Eighth Doctor New Adventures|Eighth Doctor Adventures]] and the second as part of the third season.

      <comment>deleted the second line as it sounds like nonsense: &quot;The Pearl index was invented by Tampax Pearl (refined by mother nature) and was imported to Bagdad in 1982 for the first time in anticonception-history!&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Pearl Index''', also called the '''Pearl rate''', is the most common technique used in [[clinical trials]] for reporting the effectiveness of a [[birth control]] method. 


==Calculation and usage==
&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Pearl-Index} = \frac{\mbox{Number of Pregnancies} \cdot 12} {\mbox{Number of Women}  \cdot \mbox{Number of Months}} \cdot 100&lt;/math&gt;

Three kinds of information are needed to calculate a Pearl Index for a particular study:
* The total number months or cycles of exposure by women in the study.
* The number of pregnancies.
* The reason for leaving the study (pregnancy or other reason).

There are two calculation methods for determining the Pearl Index:

In the first method, the relative number of pregnancies in the study is divided by the number of months of exposure, and then multiplied by 1200.

In the second method, the number of pregnancies in the study is divided by the number of [[menstrual cycle]]s experienced by women in the study, and then multiplied by 1300.  1300 instead of 1200 is used on the basis that the length of the average menstrual cycle is 28 days, or 13 cycles per year.

The Pearl Index is sometimes used as a statistical estimation of the number of [[unintended pregnancy|unintended pregnancies]] in 100 woman-years of exposure (e.g. 100 women over one year of use, or 10 women over 10 years). It is also sometimes used to compare birth control methods, a lower Pearl index representing a lower chance of getting unintentionally pregnant.

Usually two Pearl Indexes are published from studies of birth control methods: 
* '''Actual use''' Pearl Index, which includes all pregnancies in a study and all months (or cycles) of exposure.
* '''Perfect use''' or '''Method''' Pearl Index, which includes only pregnancies that resulted from correct and consistent use of the method, and only includes months or cycles in which the method was correctly and consistently used.

==History==
The index was introduced by [[Raymond Pearl]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;{{cite journal| author=Pearl, Raymond| title=Factors in human fertility and their statistical evaluation | journal = Lancet | volume= 222 |pages=607–611 |year=1933 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)18648-4| issue=5741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has remained popular for over seventy years, in large part because of the simplicity of the calculation.

==Criticisms==
Like all measures of birth control effectiveness, the Pearl Index is a calculation based on the observations of a given sample population. Thus studies of different populations using the same contraceptive will yield different values for the index.  The culture and demographics of the population being studied, and the instruction technique used to teach the method, have significant effects on its failure rate.&lt;ref name=Trussel1990&gt;{{cite journal | author= Trussell J | title= A guide to interpreting contraceptive efficacy studies | journal= Obstetrics and Gynecology | year= 1990 | volume= 76 |  pages= 558–567 | pmid=2199875 | issue= 3 Pt 2 | author-separator= , | author2= Hatcher RA | author3= Cates W | display-authors= 3 | last4= Stewart | first4= FH | last5= Kost | first5= K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trussel1991&gt;{{cite journal | author= Trussell J | title= Methodological pitfalls in the analysis of contraceptive failure | journal=Statistics in medicine | year=1991 | volume=10 | pages=201–220 | pmid= 2052800  | doi = 10.1002/sim.4780100206 | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pearl Index has unique shortcomings, however.  It assumes a constant failure rate over time.  That is an incorrect assumption for two reasons: first, the most fertile couples will get pregnant first.  Couples remaining later in the study are, on average, of lower fertility.  Second, most birth control methods have better effectiveness in more experienced users.  The longer a couple is in the study, the better they are at using the method.  So the longer the study length, the lower the Pearl Index will be - and comparisons of Pearl Indexes from studies of different lengths cannot be accurate.

The Pearl Index also provides no information on factors other than accidental pregnancy which may influence effectiveness calculations, such as:
* Dissatisfaction with the method
* Trying to achieve pregnancy
* Medical side effects
* Being lost to follow-up

A common misperception is that the highest possible Pearl Index is 100 - i.e. 100% of women in the study conceive in the first year.  However, if all the women in the study conceived in the first month, the study would yield a Pearl Index of 1200 or 1300.  The Pearl Index is only accurate as a statistical estimation of per-year risk of pregnancy if the pregnancy rate in the study was very low.

In 1966, two birth control statisticians advocated abandonment of the Pearl Index:&lt;ref name=Sheps1966&gt;{{cite journal | author= Sheps MC | title= Characteristics of a ratio used to estimate failure rates: occurrences per person year of exposure | journal=Biometrics | year= 1966 | volume= 22 |  pages= 310–321 | pmid=5961447  | doi = 10.2307/2528521 | issue= 2 | publisher= Biometrics, Vol. 22, No. 2 | jstor= 2528521}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Potter1966&gt;{{cite journal | author= Potter RG | title= Application of life table techniques to measurement of contraceptive effectiveness | journal=Demography | year=1966 | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages= 297–304 | doi = 10.2307/2060159 | publisher= Demography, Vol. 3, No. 2 | jstor=2060159 | pmid= 21318704}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''[The Pearl Index] does not serve as an estimator of any quantity of interest, and comparisons between groups may be impossible to interpret... The superiority of life table methods or other estimators that do not assume a constant hazard rate seems clear.''&lt;!--

'''Paul Benjamin Auster''' (born February 3, 1947) is an American author and director whose writing blends [[absurdism]], [[existentialism]], [[crime fiction]], and the search for identity and personal meaning in works such as ''[[The New York Trilogy]]'' (1987), ''[[Moon Palace]]'' (1989), ''[[The Music of Chance]]'' (1990), ''[[The Book of Illusions]]'' (2002), and ''[[Brooklyn Follies|The Brooklyn Follies]]'' (2005).

==Biography==
Auster was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=JPost&gt;Freeman, John. [http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207159751661&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull &quot;At home with Siri and Paul&quot;], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', April 3, 2008. Accessed September 19, 2008. &quot;Like so many people in New York, both of them are spiritual refugees of a sort. Auster hails from Newark, New Jersey, and Hustvedt from Minnesota, where she was raised the daughter of a professor, among a clan of very tall siblings.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Jew]]ish middle class parents of [[Poles|Polish]] descent, Queenie (née Bogat) and Samuel Auster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=GboRwPZNXzkC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=Queenie+Bogat+Samuel+Auster&amp;hl=en |title=Conversations with Paul Auster - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[South Orange, New Jersey]] &lt;ref&gt;Begley, Adam. [http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/06/20/specials/auster-92mag.html &quot;Case of the Brooklyn Symbolist&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 30, 1992. Accessed September 19, 2008. &quot;The grandson of first-generation Jewish immigrants, he was born in Newark in 1947, grew up in South Orange and attended high school in Maplewood, 20 miles southwest of New York.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]&lt;ref&gt;Auster, Paul. ''Winter Journal'' (New York, NY: Henry Holt, 2012), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from [[Columbia High School (New Jersey)|Columbia High School]] in [[Maplewood, New Jersey|Maplewood]].&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Hadley. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2002/oct/26/fiction.fashion &quot;American dreams: He may be known as one of New York's coolest chroniclers, but Paul Auster grew up in suburban New Jersey and worked on an oil tanker before achieving literary success. Hadley Freeman meets a modernist with some very traditional views&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', October 26, 2002. Accessed September 19, 2008. &quot;Education: Columbia High School, New Jersey; 1965-69 Columbia College, New York; '69-70 Columbia University, New York (quit after one year)&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from [[Columbia University]] in 1970, he moved to [[Paris]], France where he earned a living translating French literature. Since returning to the U.S. in 1974, he has published poems, essays, and novels of his own, as well as translations of French writers such as [[Stéphane Mallarmé]] and [[Joseph Joubert]].

He and his second wife, writer [[Siri Hustvedt]] (the daughter of professor and scholar [[Lloyd Hustvedt]]), were married in 1981, and they live in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=JPost/&gt; Together they have one daughter, [[Sophie Auster]]. Previously, Auster was married to the writer, [[Lydia Davis]]. They have one son together, Daniel Auster.

He is also the vice-president of [[PEN American Center]].

In 2012, Auster was quoted as saying in an interview that he wouldn't visit [[Turkey]] to protest their treatment of journalists. The Turkish Prime-Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] replied: &quot;As if we need you! Who cares if you come or not?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Associated Press in Ankara |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/01/turkish-pm-paul-auster-human-rights |title=Turkish PM criticises US writer Paul Auster over human rights comments, Guardian, 01.02.2012 |publisher=Guardian |date=2013-03-27 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;According to the latest numbers gathered by International PEN, there are nearly one hundred writers imprisoned in Turkey, not to speak of independent publishers such as [[Ragip Zarakolu]], whose case is being closely watched by PEN Centers around the world&quot;, responded Auster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/paul-auster-responds-after-turkish-prime-minister-calls-him-an-ignorant-man/ |title=Paul Auster Responds After Turkish Prime Minister Calls Him ‘an Ignorant Man’, The New York Times, 01.02.2012 |location=Turkey |publisher=Artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2010, Auster has been at work on a new novel, but has said that in the past few years he has found it harder to come up with ideas: &quot;I used to have a backlog of stories, but a few years ago I found the drawers were empty. I guess I’m getting to the point where I tell myself if I can’t write another book it’s not a tragedy. Does it matter if I publish 16 or 17 novels? Unless it’s absolutely urgent, there’s no point in writing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Author interviews |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/authorinterviews/8128941/Paul-Auster-interview.html |title=Paul Auster interview |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
[[File:Paul Auster, Salman Rushdie and Shimon Peres.jpg|thumb|Auster greeting Israeli President [[Shimon Peres]] with [[Salman Rushdie]] and Caro Llewellyn in 2008]]
Following his acclaimed debut work, a memoir entitled ''[[The Invention of Solitude]]'', Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected detective stories published collectively as ''[[The New York Trilogy]]''. These books are not conventional detective stories organized around a mystery and a series of clues. Rather, he uses the detective form to address [[existentialism|existential]] issues and questions of identity, space, language, and literature, creating his own distinctively [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] (and critique of postmodernist) form in the process. Comparing the two works, Auster said, &quot;I believe the world is filled with strange events. Reality is a great deal more mysterious than we ever give it credit for. In that sense, the ''[[The New York Trilogy|Trilogy]]'' grows directly out of ''[[The Invention of Solitude]]''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mallia, Joseph. &quot;[http://bombsite.com/issues/23/articles/1062 &quot;Paul Auster&quot;], &quot;[[BOMB Magazine]]&quot;, Spring, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

The search for identity and personal meaning has permeated Auster's later publications, many of which concentrate heavily on the role of coincidence and random events (''[[The Music of Chance]]'') or increasingly, the relationships between people and their peers and environment (''[[The Book of Illusions]]'', ''[[Moon Palace]]''). Auster's heroes often find themselves obliged to work as part of someone else's inscrutable and larger-than-life schemes. In 1995, Auster wrote and co-directed the films ''[[Smoke (film)|Smoke]]'' (which won him the [[Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay]]) and ''[[Blue in the Face]]''. Auster's more recent works, ''[[Oracle Night]]'' (2003), ''[[Brooklyn Follies|The Brooklyn Follies]]'' (2005), and the novella ''[[Travels in the Scriptorium]]'', have also met critical acclaim.

===Themes===
According to a dissertation by Heiko Jakubzik at the University of Heidelberg, two central influences in Paul Auster's writing are [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] [[psychoanalysis]] and the American [[transcendentalism]] of the early to middle nineteenth century, exemplified by [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Lacan's theory declares that we enter the world through words. We observe the world through our senses, but the world we sense is structured (mediated) in our mind through language. Thus our unconscious also is structured as a language. This leaves us with a sense of [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anomaly anomaly]. We can only perceive the world through language, but we have the feeling that something is missing. This is the sense of being outside language. The world can only be constructed through language, but it always leaves something uncovered, something that cannot be told or be thought of, it may only be sensed. This is one of the central themes of Paul Auster's writing.

Lacan is considered to be one of the key figures of French [[poststructuralism]]. Some academics are keen to discern traces of other poststructuralist philosophers throughout Auster's oeuvre - mainly [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], and [[Michel de Certeau]] - although Auster has claimed to find such philosophies 'unreadable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2004/03/04/3/a-conversation-with-author-paul-auster |title=A conversation with author Paul Auster |publisher=Charlie Rose |date=2004-03-04 |accessdate=2013-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The transcendentalists believe that the symbolic order of civilization separated us from the natural order of the world. By moving into nature - as Thoreau did in ''[[Walden]]'' - it would be possible to return to this natural order.

The common factor of both ideas is the question of the meaning of symbols for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Jakubzik: ''Paul Auster und die Klassiker der American Renaissance''. Dissertation, Universität Heidelberg 1999 ([http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/7259/ online text])&lt;/ref&gt; Auster's protagonists often are writers who establish meaning in their lives through writing and they try to find their place within the natural order, to be able to live within &quot;civilization&quot; again.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and [[Herman Melville]] have also had a strong influence on Auster's writing. Not only do their characters reappear in Auster's work (such as [[William Wilson (short story)|William Wilson]] in ''City of Glass'' or Hawthorne's [[Fanshawe (novel)|Fanshawe]] in ''The Locked Room'', both from ''The New York Trilogy''), Auster also uses variations on the themes of these writers.

Paul Auster's reappearing subjects are:&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Barone (ed.): ''Beyond the Red Notebook. Essays on Paul Auster. Penn Studies in Contemporary American Fiction''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia (2. ed. 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coincidence====
Instances of coincidence may be found throughout Auster's work. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Auster claims that people are so influenced by the continuity among them that they do not see the elements of coincidence, inconsistency, and contradiction in their own lives:

{{cquote|This idea of contrasts, contradictions, paradox, I think, gets very much to the heart of what novel writing is for me. It's a way for me to express my own contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Auster from Mark Irwin, &quot;Inventing the Music of Chance&quot; In: The Review of Contemporary Fiction Vol. XIV, no. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Failure====
Failure, in Paul Auster's works, is not just the opposite of the [[happy ending]]. In ''[[Moon Palace]]'' and ''[[The Book of Illusions]]'' it comes from the individual's uncertainty about the status of one's own identity. The protagonists start a search for their own identity and reduce their life to the absolute minimum. From this zero point they gain new strength and start their new life and they also are able to regain contact with their surroundings. A similar development also may be seen in ''[[The New York Trilogy|City of Glass]]'' and ''[[The Music of Chance]]''.

Failure in this context is not the &quot;nothing&quot; - it is the beginning of something all new.

====Identity/Subjectivity====
Auster's protagonists often go through a process that reduces their support structure to an absolute minimum: they sever all contact with family and friends, go hungry, and lose or give away all their belongings. Out of this state of &quot;nothingness&quot; they either acquire new strength to reconnect with the world or they fail and disappear for good.

==Reception==
&quot;Over the past twenty-five years,&quot; opined [[Michael Dirda]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' in [[2008 in literature|2008]], &quot;Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dirda 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Dirda also has extolled his loaded virtues in ''[[The Washington Post]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ever since ''City of Glass'', the first volume of his ''New York Trilogy'', Auster has perfected a limpid, confessional style, then used it to set disoriented heroes in a seemingly familiar world gradually suffused with mounting uneasiness, vague menace and possible hallucination. His plots — drawing on elements from suspense stories, existential récit, and autobiography — keep readers turning the pages, but sometimes end by leaving them uncertain about what they've just been through.&lt;ref&gt;Dirda 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], however, offers Auster little praise in his piece &quot;Shallow Graves&quot; in the November 30, 2009, issue of [[The New Yorker]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Auster often gets instead is the worst of both worlds: fake realism and shallow skepticism. The two weaknesses are related. Auster is a compelling storyteller, but his stories are assertions rather than persuasions. They declare themselves; they hound the next revelation. Because nothing is persuasively assembled, the inevitable postmodern disassembly leaves one largely untouched. (The disassembly is also grindingly explicit, spelled out in billboard-size type.) Presence fails to turn into significant absence, because presence was not present enough.&lt;ref&gt;Wood 2009, http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2009/11/30/091130crbo_books_wood?currentPage=1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Paul Auster John Ashbery BBF 2010 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Auster with [[John Ashbery]] at the [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]
Whereas both Dirda and Wood examine Auster from the standpoint of literary critics (and fellow American authors), there are other contending viewpoints regarding Auster's reception. For example, [[Morris Berman]], a cultural historian and social critic, stated in 2012 that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It’s interesting that the theme of Paul Auster’s novels is that American society is incoherent, that it lacks a true identity, and that it’s nothing more than a hall of mirrors. He’s been saying that for decades and by and large Americans don’t know who Paul Auster is and they don’t read him. Auster is tremendously popular in Europe, he’s been translated into more than twenty languages: those are the bulk of his sales. Americans are not interested in this kind of perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=GzgY20d2MtU#! |title=Pirate Television: Morris Berman - Why America Failed |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2013-05-01}} - Berman discusses Auster beginning at 24:40 &amp; finishes at 25:08&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In 2005 his daughter, [[Sophie Auster|Sophie]], recorded an album of songs in both French and English, entitled ''Sophie Auster'', with the band [[One Ring Zero]]. The lyrics of three of the songs (in English) are by Paul Auster; and he also provided for the accompanying booklet translations of several French poems which form the lyrics of other songs on the album.

* In 1993, a movie adaptation of ''[[The Music of Chance (film)|The Music of Chance]]'' was released. Auster features in a cameo role at the end of the film.

* In 1994 ''City of Glass'' was adapted as a graphic novel by artist [[David Mazzucchelli]] and [[Paul Karasik]]. Auster's friend, noted cartoonist [[Art Spiegelman]], produced the adaptation.

* Jazz trumpeter and composer [[Michael Mantler]]'s album ''Hide and Seek'' uses words by Auster from the play of the same name.

* Paul Auster's voice may be heard on the 2005 album entitled ''We Must Be Losing It'' by [[The Farangs]]. The two tracks are entitled &quot;Obituary in the Present Tense&quot; and &quot;Between the Lines&quot;.

* In 2006 Paul Auster directed the film ''[[The Inner Life of Martin Frost]]'', based on an original screenplay by him.

Paul Auster is heard reading from his books ''Hand to Mouth'' and ''The Red Notebook'', either as straight recitation, integrated with other sounds as if in a radio play, or passed through an electronically realized string resonator so that the low tones interact with those of a string ensemble. A film by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster runs throughout the work featuring the cabaret artist and actress Georgette Dee.

[[File:Plain text.png|thumb|right|350px|Text file of The Human Side of Animals by [[Royal Dixon]], displayed by the command &lt;code&gt;cat&lt;/code&gt; in an [[xterm]] window]]
In [[computing]], '''plain text''' is the contents of an ordinary sequential file readable as textual material without much processing, usually opposed to [[formatted text]] and to &quot;binary files&quot; in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).

The [[Character encoding|encoding]] has traditionally been either [[ASCII]], one of its many derivatives such as [[ISO/IEC 646]] etc., or sometimes [[EBCDIC]]. [[Unicode]]-based encodings such as [[UTF-8]] and [[UTF-16]] are gradually replacing the older ASCII derivatives limited to 7 or 8 bit codes.

==Plain text and rich text==
Files that contain [[markup language|markup]] or other [[meta-data]] are generally considered plain-text, as long as the entirety remains in directly [[human-readable]] form (as in [[HTML]], [[XML]], and so on (as Coombs, Renear, and DeRose argue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=November 1987|title=Markup systems and the future of scholarly text processing|journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]]|volume=30|issue=11|pages=933–947|doi=10.1145/32206.32209|url=http://xml.coverpages.org/coombs.html|first1=James H.|last1=Coombs|first2=Allen H. |last2=Renear|first3=Steven J. |last3=DeRose}}&lt;/ref&gt; punctuation is itself markup)). The use of plain text rather than bit-streams to express markup, enables files to survive much better &quot;in the wild&quot;, in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities.

According to The Unicode Standard,
*  «''Plain text'' is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Unicode-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.»
* ''styled text'', also known as ''rich text'', is any text representation containing plain text completed by information such as a language identifier, font size, color, hypertext links.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/ The Unicode Standard, version 6.1, General Structure, page 14]&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, Rich text such as SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, and TEX relies on plain text. Wiki technology is another such example.

According to The Unicode Standard, plain text has two main properties in regard to rich text:
* «plain text is the underlying content stream to which formatting can be applied.»
* «Plain text is public, standardized, and universally readable.».&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/ The Unicode Standard, version 6.1, General Structure, page 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plain text, the Unicode definition==

* «Plain text represents the basic, interchangeable content of text.»
* «Plain text represents character content only, not its appearance. »
* «It can be displayed in a variety of ways and requires a rendering process to make it visible with a particular appearance.»
* «If the same plain text sequence is given to disparate rendering processes, there is no expectation that rendered text in each instance should have the same appearance. »
* «Instead, the disparate rendering processes are simply required to make the text legible according to the intended reading. »
* «This legibility criterion constrains the range of possible appearances. »
* «The relationship between appearance and content of plain text may be summarized as follows: Plain text must contain enough information to permit the text to be rendered legibly, and nothing more.»
* «The Unicode Standard encodes plain text.»
* «The distinction between plain text and other forms of data in the same data stream is the function of a higher-level protocol and is not specified by the Unicode Standard itself.».&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode6.1.0/ The Unicode Standard, version 6.1, General Structure, page 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reference necessary|text=More formally, the fundamental distinction of &quot;plain text&quot; is that no information would be lost if you went through and translated the file to a completely different [[character encoding]], or translated it to ''no'' encoding by just printing it out generically (provided the printer has a good enough font that you can correctly distinguish all the characters!). No information is conveyed by the fact that an &quot;A&quot; in the printout was originally stored as a byte with value 65 (as it would be in [[ASCII]]), or with value 193 (as in [[EBCDIC]]); and it certainly wasn't meant to express half of the bits of an integer.{{Clarify|post-text=(complicated jargon)|date=April 2012}} |date=July 2012}}

==Usage==

The purpose of using '''''plain text''''' today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting, and from computer architecture issues such as [[byte order]], etc. Plain text files can be opened, read, and edited with countless generic [[text editor]]s and utilities. Examples include [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]] ([[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]), [[MS-DOS Editor|edit]] ([[DOS]]), [[ed (text editor)|ed]], [[emacs]], [[vi]], [[vim (text editor)|vim]], [[Gedit]] or [[nano (text editor)|nano]] ([[Unix]], [[Linux]]), [[SimpleText]] ([[Mac OS]]), or [[TextEdit]] ([[Mac OS X]]). 

Many other computer programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text, such as countless commands in [[DOS]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[MacOS]], and [[Unix]] and its kin; as well as web browsers (a few browsers such as [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]] and the [[Line Mode Browser]] produce only plain text for display).

Plain text files are almost universal in programming; a source code file containing instructions in a [[programming language]] is almost always a plain text file. Plain text is also commonly used for [[configuration file]]s, which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program, and for much [[e-mail]].

==Encoding==

===Character encodings===
{{main|Character encoding}}
Before the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character, permitting only 64 characters—assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as [[Roberto Busa]]'s [[Index Thomisticus]], the [[Brown Corpus]], and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be upper-case.

[[Fred Brooks]] of [[IBM]] argued strongly for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text; and won. Although IBM used [[EBCDIC]], most text from then on came to be encoded in [[ASCII]], using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing) [[control characters]], and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a [[checksum]]).

The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign (&quot;$&quot;) was not so useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed—often re-assigning control characters, or using value in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.

These additional characters were encoded differently in different countries, making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator's rules. For instance, a browser might display '''¬A''' rather than '''`''' if it tried to interpret one character set as another. The International Organisation for Standardisation ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]) eventually developed several [[code pages]] under [[ISO 8859]], to accommodate various languages. The first of these ([[ISO 8859-1]]) is also known as &quot;Latin-1&quot;, and covers the needs of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters (there was not quite enough room to cover them all). [[ISO 2022]] then provided conventions for &quot;switching&quot; between different character sets in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these, and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible variations.

The text-encoding situation became more and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the [[Unicode Consortium]] to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict,{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} these efforts were unified. [[Unicode]] currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones and for many non-linguistic characters such as printer's [[dingbat]]s, mathematical symbols, etc.

Text is considered plain-text regardless of its encoding. To properly understand or process it the recipient must know (or be able to figure out) what encoding was used; however, they need not know anything about the computer architecture that was used, or about the binary structures defined by whatever program (if any) created the data.

===Control codes===
{{main|Newline}}
The ASCII codes before &lt;code&gt;SPACE&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;code&gt;32&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;20&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) are not intended as displayable characters, but instead as [[control character]]s. They are used for diverse interpreted meanings. For example, the code &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, sometimes denoted &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-@&lt;/code&gt;) is used as string end markers in the programming language C and successors. Most troublesome of these are the codes &lt;code&gt;LF&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;code&gt;LINE FEED&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;0A&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt; (= &lt;code&gt;CARRIAGE RETURN&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;13&lt;/code&gt; = &lt;code&gt;0D&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/code&gt;). Windows and [[OS/2]] require the sequence &lt;code&gt;CR,LF&lt;/code&gt; to represent a newline, while [[Unix]] and relatives use just the &lt;code&gt;LF&lt;code&gt;, and Classic [[Mac OS]] (but not [[Mac OS X]]) uses just the code &lt;code&gt;CR&lt;/code&gt;. This was once a slight problem when transferring files between Windows and Unix systems, but today most computer programs treat this seamlessly.

In 8-bit character sets such as Latin-1 and the other ISO 8859 sets, the first 32 characters of the &quot;upper half&quot; (128 to 159) are also control codes, known as the &quot;C1 set&quot; as opposed to the &quot;C0&quot; set just described. However, the commonplace Windows character set called code page 1252 assigns printing characters to these [[code points]] (other than this, cp1252 is the same as Latin-1). It is not uncommon that Web servers identify a document as being in Latin-1, when in fact it is in code page 1252, and uses characters in the C1 set as graphics. This may or may not lead to unexpected results.

The '''Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)''', or '''PC(USA)''', is a [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] [[Protestant]] [[Christian denomination]] in the [[United States]]. Part of the [[Reformed]] tradition, it is the largest [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] denomination in the U.S., followed by the [[Presbyterian Church in America]]. The PC(USA) was established by the 1983 merger of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]], whose churches were located in the [[Southern U.S.|Southern]] and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]], with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]], whose [[Local church|congregations]] could be found in every state.

With 1,952,287 members and 21,064  [[ordination|ordained]] [[minister of religion|minister]]s in 10,657 congregations at the end of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = PC(USA) | format = research | title = Go Figure | date = 12/2010 | format = [[PDF]] | url= http://www.pcusa.org/media/uploads/research/pdfs/gofigure-201012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the reunited denomination is the most visible and influential Presbyterian denomination in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work =FAQ | title = Interesting Facts |url=http://www.pcusa.org/research/statistics_faq.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The denomination reported a loss of 61,047 members (−2.9%) in 2010, a loss of 63,804 in 2011 and had a membership of 1,952,287 at the end of 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;{{Citation | publisher = PC (USA) | url = http://www.pcusa.org/media/uploads/oga/pdf/2011-comparative-summaries-stats.pdf | title = Summaries of Statistics | contribution = Comparative Summaries | year = 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Denominational offices are located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].

==History==

===Origins===
[[Image:Stillwaterpreschurch.jpg|thumb|right|253px|Built in 1837-1838, the edifice of the [[Stillwater Presbyterian Church (Stillwater, New Jersey)|Stillwater Presbyterian Church]], in Stillwater, New Jersey, is prime example of [[Greek Revival architecture]], despite its Gothic-inspired windows. The congregation, formed in 1769 as a union church between the Reformed and Lutheran faiths of the town's Palatine German settlers, joined the [[Presbytery of Newton]] in 1822.]]
Presbyterians trace their history to the 16th century and the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Presbyterian heritage, and much of what they believe, began with the Swiss/French theologian and lawyer [[John Calvin]] (1509–64), whose writings solidified much of the [[Reformed]] thinking that came before him.

Calvin did most of his writing from [[Geneva, Switzerland]].  From there, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe. [[John Knox]], a Scotsman who studied with Calvin in Geneva, Switzerland, took Calvin's teachings back to Scotland (see [[Scottish Reformation]]).  Other Reformed communities developed in England, Holland and France. The Presbyterian church traces its ancestry back primarily to Scotland.

The early Presbyterians in America came from Scotland and Ireland. The first American [[Presbyterian polity|Presbytery]] was organized at Philadelphia in 1706. The first General Assembly of the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (PCUSA) was held in the same city in 1789. The Assembly was convened by the Rev. [[John Witherspoon]], the only minister to sign the [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|Declaration of Independence]]. This was indicative of the active support of most Presbyterians for the [[American War of Independence]].

The [[First Great Awakening]] had a major impact on the American Presbyterians. Inspired by the [[evangelism|evangelical]] preaching of [[George Whitefield]] and others, [[Gilbert Tennent]] delivered a sermon in West Nottingham, Maryland in 1740 on &quot;The Dangers of an Unconverted Ministry.&quot; In the sermon, he asserted some current Presbyterian church leaders might be academic &quot;[[Pharisee]]-teachers&quot; who did not have the same faith or enthusiasm as newly converted followers, a controversial view which divided the church. Together with his brother [[William Tennent]], he led the Presbyterian part of the Great Awakening revivalist movement in America.

In the South the Presbyterians were evangelical dissenters, mostly [[Scots-Irish Americans]] who expanded into Virginia between 1740 and 1758. Spangler (2008) argues they were more energetic and held frequent services better atuned to the frontier conditions of the colony. Presbyterianism grew in frontier areas where the Anglicans had made little impression. Uneducated whites and blacks were attracted to the emotional worship of the denomination, its emphasis on biblical simplicity, and its psalm singing. Presbyterians were a cross-section of society; they were involved in slaveholding and in patriarchal ways of household management, while the Presbyterian Church government featured few democratic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jewel L | last = Spangler | title = Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century | publisher = University Press of Virginia | 2008 | ISBN 978-0-8139-2679-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp| needed = yes|date=July 2012}}  Some local Presbyterian churches, such as Briery in Prince Edward County, owned slaves. The Briery church purchased five slaves in 1766 and raised money for church expenses by hiring them out to local planters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jennifer | last = Oast | title = 'The Worst Kind of Slavery': Slave-Owning Presbyterian Churches in Prince Edward County, Virginia | journal = Journal of Southern History | month = Nov | year = 2010 | volume = 76 | issue = 4 | pages = 867–900}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:First Presbyterian Church of Houston.jpg|thumb|250px|First Presbyterian Church of Houston]]
In the early years of the 19th century, the church carried on revivals and organized congregations, presbyteries, and [[Presbyterian polity|synods]] wherever pastors and lay people went, emphasizing the connectional nature of the church. Presbyterians also helped to shape voluntary societies that encouraged educational, missionary, evangelical, and reforming work. As the church began to realize that these functions were corporate in nature and as the century proceeded, it formed its own boards and agencies to address these needs at home and abroad. Mission to [[Native Americans (U.S.)|Native Americans]], [[African Americans]], and populations all over the world became a hallmark of the church.

The 19th century was also characterized by disagreement and division over theology, governance, and reform - particularly [[slavery]]. In 1803, [[Barton W. Stone]] led a group of revivalist [[New Light]] Presbyterian ministers to form independent [[Springfield Presbytery]] which eventually became the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]]. In 1810, a number of Presbyterian congregations and ministers, ejected by [[Kentucky Synod]] for their pro-revival position and their relaxation of ordination requirements in a frontier setting, formed the [[Cumberland Presbyterian]] denomination, although they never intended the split to be permanent. In 1837, the church was split by the [[Old School-New School Controversy]]. The century also saw the formation of the [[United Presbyterian Church of North America]]. When the country could not reconcile the issue of slavery and the federal union, the southern Presbyterians split from the original PCUSA, forming the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America in 1861, which became the [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] after the [[American Civil War]].

===20th century to the present===
{{Main|Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy}}
[[File:Church of the Pilgrims - Blizzard of 2010.JPG|thumb|Church of the Pilgrims (1928) in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The early part of the 20th century saw continued growth in both major sections of the church. It also saw the growth of [[Fundamentalist Christianity]] (a movement of those who believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible as the fundamental source of the religion) as distinguished from [[Modernist Christianity]] (a movement holding the belief that Christianity needed to be re-interpreted in light of modern scientific theories such as [[evolution]] or the rise of degraded social conditions brought on by [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]).

This controversy reached a head in 1924 after the General Assembly of the PCUSA adopted five &quot;essential and necessary&quot; pillars of Christian belief. This move toward aggressively anti-modernist [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalism]] caused a backlash in the form of the [[Auburn Affirmation]] — a document embracing modernism and &quot;liberty of thought and teaching.&quot; Although the 1930s and 1940s and the ensuing [[neo-orthodox]] theological consensus mitigated much of the polemics during the mid-20th century, disputes erupted again beginning in the mid-1960s, over the extent of involvement in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and the issue of [[ordination of women]], and, especially since the 1990s, over the issue of ordination of gays and lesbians.

====Mergers====
[[Image:Presbyterian Family Connections.jpg|thumb|200px|Center|Evolution of Presbyterianism in the United States. Courtesy of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.]]
The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]], mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America]] (UPCUSA).

This sparked a period of ecumenical activism which culminated in the UPCUSA's development of the [[Confession of 1967]] which was the church's first new confession of faith in three centuries. The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and amended the draft confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly finally adopted it in 1967.

An attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept [[centralization]]. This reflected its support for local decision making and concern about central organizations having greater power, a historically Southern attitude about civil government as well as ecclesiastical. In the meantime, a conservative group broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973, mainly over the issues of women's ordination and a perceived drift toward theological liberalism. This group formed the [[Presbyterian Church in America]] (PCA).

Attempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. At the time of the merger, the churches had a combined membership of 3,121,238.&lt;ref name=&quot;membership loss&quot;&gt;Kibler, Craig M. [http://www.layman.org/News.aspx?article=23664 PCUSA projects largest membership loss ever in 2007]. ''Presbyterian Layman'', February 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the efforts were spearheaded by the financial and outspoken activism of retired businessman [[Thomas Clinton]] who died two years before the merger.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A new national headquarters was established in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1988 replacing the headquarters of the UPCUSA in [[New York City]] and the PCUS located in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].

The merger essentially consolidated those moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body. Practically all other U.S. Presbyterian bodies (the Cumberland Presbyterians being a partial exception) profess some measure of doctrinal [[Calvinist]] propositionalism, literalist hermeneutics, and conservative politics.

For the most part, PC(USA) Presbyterians, not unlike similar mainline traditions such as the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] and the [[United Church of Christ]], are fairly (in some instances, strongly) progressive (liberal) on matters such as doctrine, environmental issues, sexual morality, and economic issues, though the denomination remains divided and conflicted on these issues. Like other mainline denominations, the PC(USA) has also seen a great deal of demographic aging, with fewer and fewer new members and a steadily declining membership total in every consecutive year since 1967. 

A recent phenomenon is that of conservative-minded groups in the PC(USA) (such as the Confessing church movement) remaining in the main body, rather than leaving to form new, break-away groups, as those most theologically conservative usually did (e.g., the [[Presbyterian Church in America]], the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)|Evangelical Presbyterian Church]], the [[Orthodox Presbyterian Church]], and the [[Bible Presbyterian Church]]).  However, a new split-away denomination has been established as of January 2012 called the [[Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians]].

====Youth====
Since 1983 the Presbyterian Youth Triennium has been held every three years at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, U.S. and is open to Presbyterian high school students throughout the world.  The very first Youth Triennium was held in 1980 at Indiana University and the conference for teens is an effort of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the largest Presbyterian denomination in the nation; Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the first African American denomination to embrace Presbyterianism in the reformed tradition.  For information on this year's triennium, go to http://presbyterianyouthtriennium.org/

==Structure==
{{Main|Presbyterian church governance}}

===Constitution===
The Constitution of PC(USA) is composed of two portions: Part I, the ''[[Book of Confessions]]'' and Part II, the ''[[Book of Order]]''. The ''Book of Confessions'' outlines the beliefs of the PC(USA) by declaring the creeds by which the Church's leaders are instructed and led. Complementing that is the ''Book of Order'' which gives the rationale and description for the organization and function of the Church at all levels. The ''Book of Order'' is currently divided into three sections - 1) Form of Government, 2) The Directory For Worship, and 3) The Rules of Discipline.

===Councils===
{{Main|List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries}}
{{See also|List of Moderators of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA)}}
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has a representative form of government, known as [[presbyterian polity]], with four levels of government and administration, as outlined in the ''Book of Order''. The councils(governing bodies) are as follows: 
# Session (of a Congregation)
# Presbytery
# Synod
# General Assembly

====Session====
At the congregational level, the governing body is called the ''session'', from the Latin word ''sessio'', meaning &quot;a sitting&quot;. The session is made up of the pastors of the church and all [[Elder (religious)|elders]] elected and installed to active service. Following a pattern set in the first congregation of Christians in Jerusalem described in the [[Book of Acts]] in the [[New Testament]], the church is governed by ''presbyters'' (a term and category that includes elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament, historically also referred to as &quot;ruling or canon elders&quot; because they ''measure'' the spiritual life and work of a congregation and ministers as &quot;teaching elders&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/theologyandworship/issues/unplumin.pdf | format = article | contribution = Undivided Plural Ministries | title = Theology &amp; worship | publisher = PC (USA) | format = [[PDF]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The elders are nominated by a nominating committee of the congregation; in addition, nominations from the floor are permissible. Elders are then elected by the congregation. All elders elected to serve on the congregation's session of elders are required to undergo a period of study and preparation for this order of ministry, after which the session examines the elders-elect as to their personal faith; knowledge of doctrine, government, and discipline contained in the Constitution of the church, and the duties of the office of elder. If the examination is approved, the session appoints a day for the service of ordination and installation.{{Sfn | General Assembly | 2009 | loc = G-14.0240}}  Session meetings are normally moderated by a called and installed pastor and minutes are recorded by a clerk, who is also an ordained presbyter.  If the congregation does not have an installed pastor, the Presbytery appoints a minister member or elected member of the presbytery as moderator with the concurrence of the local church session.{{Sfn | General Assembly | 2009 | loc = G-9.0202b}}  The moderator presides over the session as [[primus inter pares]] and as moderator also serves a &quot;liturgical&quot; bishop over the ordination and installation of elders and deacons within a particular congregation.

The session takes care of the guidance and direction of the ministry of the local church, including almost all responsibilities of spiritual and fiduciary leadership. The congregation as a whole has only the responsibility to vote on: 1) the call of the pastor (subject to presbytery approval) and the terms of call (the church's provision for compensating and caring for the pastor); 2) the election of its own officers (elders &amp; deacons); 3) buying, mortgaging, or selling real property. All other church matters such as the budget, personnel matters, and all programs for spiritual life and mission, are the responsibility of the session.  In addition, the session serves as an ecclesiastical court to consider disciplinary charges brought against church officers or members.

The session also oversees the work of the [[deacons]], a second body of leaders also tracing its origins to the Book of Acts. The deacons are a congregational-level group whose duty is &quot;to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress both within and beyond the community of faith.&quot; In some churches, the responsibilities of the deacons are taken care of by the session, so there is no board of deacons in that church. In some states, churches are legally incorporated and members or elders of the church serve as trustees of the corporation. However, &quot;the power and duties of such trustees shall not infringe upon the powers and duties of the Session or of the board of deacons.&quot; The deacons are a ministry board but not a governing body.

====Presbytery====
A ''presbytery'' is formed by all the congregations and the Ministers of Word and Sacrament in a geographic area together with elders selected (proportional to congregation size) from each of the congregations. Four PC(USA) synods (see below) have a non-geographical presbytery for Korean language Presbyterian congregations. One synod has a non-geographical presbytery for Native American congregations, the Dakota Presbytery.  There are currently 173 presbyteries for the more than 10,000 congregations in the PC(USA).  The five presbyteries are &quot;non-geographical&quot; only in that they overlay other pre-existing English-speaking geographical presbyteries; they are in fact &quot;geographical&quot; in that they are geographically limited to the boundaries of a particular synod. It may be more accurate to refer to them as &quot;trans-geographical&quot; presbyteries.   

Only the presbytery (not a congregation, session, synod, or General Assembly) has the responsibility and authority to ordain church members to the Ministry of Word and Sacrament, to install Ministers of Word and Sacrament to (and/or remove them from) congregations, and to remove a minister from the Ministry of Word and Sacrament. A Minister of Word and Sacrament is a Presbyterian minister only by virtue of membership on a roll of a presbytery. The Office of the General Assembly maintains and publishes a national directory with the help of each presbytery's stated clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://ogasys2.pcusa.org/mrcjava/mnstrinqy/i00010gc.mrc | publisher = PC (USA) | title = Directory | accessdate = Nov 28, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bound versions are published bi-annually with the minutes of the General Assembly.&lt;/ref&gt; A pastor cannot be a member of the congregation he or she serves as pastor because his or her primary ecclesiastical accountability lies with the presbytery. Members of the congregation generally choose their own pastor with the assistance and support of the presbytery. The presbytery must approve the choice and officially install the pastor at the congregation.  Additionally, the presbytery must approve if either the congregation or the pastor wishes to dissolve that pastoral relationship. 

The presbytery has authority over many affairs of its local congregations. Only the presbytery can approve the establishment, dissolution, or merger of congregations. The presbytery also maintains a Permanent Judicial Commission, which acts as a court of appeal from sessions, and which exercises original jurisdiction in disciplinary cases against minister members of the presbytery.{{Sfn | General Assembly | 2009 | loc = The Rules of Discipline}}

A presbytery has two elected officers: a moderator and a stated clerk.  The Moderator of the presbytery is elected annually and is either a minister member or an elder commissioner from one of the presbytery's congregations. The Moderator presides at all presbytery assemblies and is the chief overseer at the ordination and installation of ministers in that presbytery.{{Sfn | General Assembly | 2009 | loc = The Rules of Discipline W-4.4003}}  The stated clerk is the chief ecclesial officer and serves as the presbytery's executive secretary and parliamentarian in accordance with the church Constitution and Robert's Rules of Order. While the moderator of a presbytery normally serves one year, the stated clerk normally serves a designated number of years and may be re-elected indefinitely by the presbytery. Additionally, an Executive [[Presbyter]] (sometimes designated as General Presbyter, Pastor to Presbytery, Transitional Presbyter) is often elected as a staff person to care for the administrative duties of the presbytery, often with the additional role of a pastor to the pastors. Presbyteries may be creative in the designation and assignment of duties for their staff. A presbytery is required to elect a Moderator and a Clerk, but the practice of hiring staff is optional. Presbyteries must meet at least twice a year, but they have the discretion to meet more often and most do.

====Synod====
Presbyteries are organized within a geographical region to form a ''synod''. Each synod contains at least three presbyteries, and its elected voting membership is to include both elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament in equal numbers. Synods have various duties depending on the needs of the presbyteries they serve. In general, their responsibilities (G-12.0102) might be summarized as: developing and implementing the mission of the church throughout the region, facilitating communication between presbyteries and the General Assembly, and mediating conflicts between the churches and presbyteries. Every synod elects a Permanent Judicial Commission, which has original jurisdiction in remedial cases brought against its constituent presbyteries, and which also serves as an ecclesiastical court of appeal for decisions rendered by its presbyteries' Permanent Judicial Commissions.  Synods are required to meet at least biennially. Meetings are moderated by an elected synod Moderator with support of the synod's Stated Clerk. There are currently 16 synods in the PC(USA) and they vary widely in the scope and nature of their work. An ongoing current debate in the denomination is over the purpose, function, and need for synods.

====Synods of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)====

====General Assembly====
The ''General Assembly'' is the highest governing body of the PC(USA). Until the 216th assembly met in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 2004, the General Assembly met once a year; since 2004, the General Assembly has met biennially in even-numbered years. It consists of commissioners elected by presbyteries (not synods), and its voting membership is proportioned with parity between elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament. There are many important responsibilities of the General Assembly. Among them, ''The Book of Order'' lists these four:
# to set priorities for the work of the church in keeping with the church's mission under Christ
# to develop overall objectives for mission and a comprehensive strategy to guide the church at every level of its life
# to provide the essential program functions that are appropriate for overall balance and diversity within the mission of the church, and
# to establish and administer national and worldwide ministries of witness, service, growth, and development.

The General Assembly elects a [[Moderator of the General Assembly|moderator]] at each assembly who moderates the rest of the sessions of that assembly meeting and continues as moderator until the next assembly convenes (two years later) to elect a new moderator. The current Moderator of the 220th General Assembly (2012) is Rev. Neal Presa. The moderator of the 219th General Assembly (2010) was Ruling Elder [[Cynthia Bolbach]].  The moderator of the 218th General Assembly was the [[Bruce Reyes-Chow|Rev. Bruce Reyes-Chow]]. 

A Stated Clerk is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for the Office of the General Assembly which conducts the ecclesiastical work of the church. The Office of the General Assembly carries out most of the ecumenical functions and all of the constitutional functions at the Assembly. The current Stated Clerk of the General Assembly is the Rev. Gradye Parsons.

The Stated Clerk is also responsible for the records of the denomination, a function formalized in 1925 when the General Assembly created the “Department of Historical Research and Conservation” as part of the Office of the General Assembly.  The current “Department of History” is also known as the [[Presbyterian Historical Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ga1925&quot;&gt;”Minutes of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A.” Philadelphia, Pa.: Office of the General Assembly, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

Six agencies carry out the work of the General Assembly.  These are the Office of the General Assembly, the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Investment and Loan Program, the Board of Pensions, the Presbyterian Foundation, and the Presbyterian Mission Agency (formerly known as the General Assembly Mission Council).  

The General Assembly elects members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (formerly General Assembly Mission Council). There are 48 elected members of the Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (40 voting members; 17 non-voting delegates), who represent synods, presbyteries, and the church at-large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) | title = General Assembly Mission Council Manual of Operations | year = 2009 | url = http://www.pcusa.org/gamc/manual09.pdf | accessdate = Dec 2, 2009 | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Members serve one six-year term, with the exception of the present Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the past Moderator of the General Assembly (one 2-year term), the moderator of Presbyterian Women (one 3-year term), ecumenical advisory members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms), and stewardship and audit committee at-large members (one 2-year term, eligible for two additional terms). Among the elected members’ major responsibilities is the coordination of the work of the program areas in light of General Assembly mission directions, objectives, goals and priorities.  The PMAB meets three times a year. The General Assembly elects an Executive Director of the Presbyterian Mission Agency who is the top administrator overseeing the mission work of the PC(USA). The current Executive Director of the PMA is Ruling Elder Linda Bryant Valentine. 

The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission (GAPJC) is the highest Church court of the denomination. It composed of one member elected by the General Assembly from each of its constituent synods (16).  It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all Synod Permanent Judicial Commission cases involving issues of Church Constitution, and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission issues Authoritative Interpretations of The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) through its decisions.

===Affiliated seminaries===
[[File:Millerchapel.jpg|thumb|right|Miller Chapel at Princeton Theological Seminary in Princeton, New Jersey]]
The denomination maintains affiliations with ten seminaries in the United States. These are:
* [[Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] in Austin, Texas
* [[Columbia Theological Seminary]] in Decatur, Georgia
* Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary at the [[Interdenominational Theological Center]] in Atlanta, Georgia
* [[Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary]] in Louisville. Kentucky
* [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in Chicago, Illinois
* [[Pittsburgh Theological Seminary]], in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* [[Princeton Theological Seminary]], the first chartered by the General Assembly, in Princeton, New Jersey
* [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]] in San Anselmo, Marin County, California
* [[Union Presbyterian Seminary]] in Richmond, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina
* University of [[Dubuque Theological Seminary]] in Dubuque, Iowa

Two other seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement: [[Auburn Theological Seminary]] in New York, New York, and [[Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

There are numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States affiliated with PC(USA). For a complete list, see the article [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]]. For more information, see the article [[PC(USA) seminaries]].

===Demographics===
The PC(USA) maintains extensive statistics on its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Comparative Statistics|url=http://www.pcusa.org/research/compstats/ | publisher = PC (USA) | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total &quot;communicant&quot; membership fell by 2.9% in 2009 to 2,077,138,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.layman.org/Files/compsumstats2009.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = The Presbyterian Layman | title = Summary of Statistics | year = 2008–2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Losses continued in 2010  with a loss of 61,047 members (−2.9%) in 2010, resulting in a membership of 2,016,091 at the end of 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;layman2010&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.layman.org/news.aspx?article=28745 | newspaper = The Presbyterian Layman | date = June 30, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This continues a three decade-long decline in membership for PC(USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Go Figure: The Shrinking Church | first =Jack | last = Marcum | month = Oct | url=http://www.pcusa.org/research/gofigure/oct08.pdf |format=PDF| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcusa.org/oga/perspectives/jun05/wakeup.htm |title=A Wake-Up Call to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) | first =Clifton | last = Kirkpatrick |publisher=The Office of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the trends of most mainline Protestant denominations in America since the late 1960s.

The average Presbyterian Church has 195 members (the mean in 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PC(USA) Congregations and Membership — 1996–2006 | url = http://www.pcusa.org/research/compstats/cs2006/table1.pdf |format=PDF| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 25% of the total congregations report between 1 and 50 members. Another 23% report between 51 and 100 members.  The average worship attendance as a percentage of membership is 51.7%. The largest congregation in the PC(USA) is [[Peachtree Presbyterian Church]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], with a reported membership of 8,989 (2009).

Most PC(USA) members are white (92.9%). Other racial and ethnic members include African-Americans (3.1% of the total membership of the denomination), Asians (2.3%), Hispanics (1.2%), Native Americans (0.2%), and others (0.3%). Despite declines in the total membership of the PC(USA), the percentage of racial-ethnic minority members has stayed about the same since 1995. The ratio of female members (58%) to male members (42%) has also remained stable since the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcusa.org/pcnews/2006/06300.htm |title= PC(USA) membership declines, financial giving up| year = 2006 | publisher=Presbyterian News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
The session of the local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship within the guidelines set forth in the Directory for Worship section of the ''Book of Order''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/oga/publications/boo07-09.pdf | year = 2007–09 | publisher = PC (USA) | title = Book of Order}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. This variance is not unlike that seen in the &quot;[[High Church]]&quot; and &quot;[[Low Church]]&quot; styles of the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Church]].  The ''Book of Order'' suggests a worship service ordered around five themes: &quot;gathering around the Word, proclaiming the Word, responding to the Word, the sealing of the Word, and bearing and following the Word into the world.&quot;  Prayer is central to the service and may be silent, spoken, sung, or read in unison (including The Lord's Prayer).  Music plays a large role in most PC(USA) worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the individual church and is offered prayerfully and not &quot;for entertainment or artistic display.&quot; Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/101/101-worship.htm | publisher = PC(USA) | title = Presbyterian 101 | contribution = Worship}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |The pastor has certain responsibilities which are not subject to the authority of the session. In a particular service of worship the pastor is responsible for:
# the selection of Scripture lessons to be read,
# the preparation and preaching of the sermon or exposition of the Bible,
# the prayers offered on behalf of the people and those prepared for the use of the people in worship,
# the music to be sung,
# the use of drama, dance, and other art forms.
The pastor may confer with a worship committee in planning particular services of worship.|[W-1.4005]}}

The Directory for Worship in the [[Book of Order]] provides the directions for what must be, or may be included in worship. During the 20th century, Presbyterians were offered optional use of [[liturgical book]]s:
* [[The Book of Common Worship of 1906]]
* [[The Book of Common Worship of 1932]]
* [[The Book of Common Worship of 1946]]
*[[The Worshipbook of 1970]] (spelling is correct)
*[[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]]

For more information, see [[Liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA)]]

In regard to [[vestments]], the Directory for Worship leaves that decision up to the ministers. Thus, on a given Sunday moring service, a congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the [[Paleo-orthodoxy]] and [[emerging church]] Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black [[Geneva gown]] and reclaiming not only the more ancient [[Eucharist]] vestments of [[alb]] and [[chasuble]], but also [[cassock]] and [[surplice]] (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the [[Celts|Celtic]] alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old [[Gallican Rite]]).

===The Service for the Lord's Day===
The Service for the Lord's Day is the name given to the general format or ordering of worship in the Presbyterian Church as outlined in its Constitution's [[Book of Order]].  There is a great deal of liberty given toward worship in that denomination, so while the underlying order and components for the Service for the Lord's Day is extremely common, it varies from congregation to congregation, region to region.

The creation of the Service for the Lord's Day was one of the most positive contributions of [[the Worshipbook of 1970]].  [[The Book of Common Worship of 1993]] leaned heavily upon this service.

==Missions==
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has, in the past, been a leading United States denomination in mission work, and many hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities worldwide trace their origins to the pioneering work of Presbyterian missionaries who founded them more than a century ago.

Currently, despite having more than 2 million members, the church supports less than 215 missionaries abroad annually. This may be represented more starkly by the fact that, as of the proposed missionary goals of 2009, missionaries as a function of total church membership represent less than %0.008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Riley | first = Jennifer | year = 2008 | title = PC(USA) Poised to Grow World Mission Christian Post | journal = Christian post | url = http://www.christianpost.com/article/20080505/pc-usa-poised-to-grow-world-mission.htm | date = 2008‐5‐5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted that many churches sponsor missionaries abroad at the session level, and these are not included in official statistics.

A vital part of the world mission emphasis of the denomination is building and maintaining relationships with Presbyterian, Reformed and other churches around the world, even if this is not usually considered missions.

The PC(USA) is a leader in disaster assistance relief and also participates in or relates to work in other countries through ecumenical relationships, in what is usually considered not missions, but deaconship.

== Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships ==
The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) determines and approves ecumenical statements, agreements, and maintains correspondence with other Presbyterian and Reformed bodies, other Christians churches, alliances, councils, and consortia. Ecumenical statements and agreements are subject to the ratification of the presbyteries. The following are some of the major ecumenical agreements and partnerships.

The church is committed to &quot;engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with other churches and traditions in order to remove barriers of misunderstanding and establish common affirmations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) | title = Office of the General Assembly | contribution = Department of Ecumenical and Agency Relationships | url = http://www.pcusa.org/dear/ecurelations.htm | accessdate = Dec 12, 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012 it is in dialog with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the [[Moravian Church]], the Korean American Presbyterian Church, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]], the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America]], and the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. It also participates in international dialogues through the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]. The most recent international dialogues include Pentecostal churches, [[Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Orthodox Church in America]], and others.

=== National and international ecumenical memberships ===
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is in corresponding partnership with the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], and the [[World Council of Churches]].  It is a member of [[Churches for Middle East Peace]].

=== Formula of agreement ===
In 1997 four churches of Reformation heritage acted on an ecumenical proposal of historic importance. The timing reflected a doctrinal consensus which had been developing over the past thirty-two years coupled with an increasing urgency for the church to proclaim a gospel of unity in contemporary society. In light of identified doctrinal consensus, desiring to bear visible witness to the unity of the Church, and hearing the call to engage together in God’s mission, it was recommended:

{{quote |That the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the [[Reformed Church in America]], and the [[United Church of Christ]] declare on the basis of A Common Calling and their adoption of this A Formula of Agreement that they are in full communion with one another. Thus, each church is entering into or affirming full communion with three other churches.&lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) Book of Order (2009/2011). C-1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term “full communion” is understood here to specifically mean that the four churches: 

* recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God;

* withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the life and faith of our churches today;

* continue to recognize each other’s Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord’s Supper among their members; recognize each other's various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament;

* establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches;
commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service; 

* pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow.

The agreement assumed the doctrinal consensus articulated in A Common Calling:The Witness of Our Reformation Churches in North America Today, and is to be viewed in concert with that document. The purpose of A Formula of Agreement is to elucidate the
complementarity of affirmation and admonition as the basic principle of entering into full communion and the implications of that action as described in A Common Calling.

The 209th General Assembly (1997) approved A Formula of Agreement and in 1998 the 210th General Assembly declared full communion among these Protestant bodies.

=== National and international ecumenical memberships ===
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is in corresponding partnership with the [[National Council of Churches]], the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], [[Christian Churches Together]], and the [[World Council of Churches]].

=== World Communion of Reformed Churches ===
In June 2010, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches will merge with the [[Reformed Ecumenical Council]] to form the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]. The result will be a form of full communion similar to that outline in the Formula of Agreement, including orderly exchange of ministers.

=== Churches Uniting in Christ ===
The PC (U.S.A.) is one of nine denominations that joined together to form the [[Consultation on Church Union]], which initially sought a merger of the denominations. In 1998 the Seventh Plenary of the Consultation on Church Union approved a document &quot;Churches in Covenant Communion: The Church of Christ Uniting&quot; as a plan for the formation of a covenant communion of churches. In 2002 the nine denominations inaugurated the new relationship and became known as [[Churches Uniting in Christ]]. The partnership is considered incomplete until the partnering communions reconcile their understanding of Holy Orders and devise and orderly exchange of clergy.

==Current controversies==
{{Main|Homosexuality and Presbyterianism}}
[[File:Gay friendly church.jpg|thumb|[[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|Rainbow flag]] above the entrance to a Presbyterian church]]
The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is currently struggling with the issue of Biblical interpretation and faithfulness, particularly as it relates to [[homosexuality]]. Paragraph G-6.0106b of the [[Book of Order]] prohibited the ordination of those who are not faithful in marriage or chaste in singleness. This paragraph was included in the Book of Order from 1997–2011, and was commonly referred to by its pre-ratification designation, &quot;Amendment B&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/101/101-homosexual.htm | title = Presbyterian 101 | contribution = Social Issues: Homosexuality | publisher = PC (USA)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several attempts were made to remove this from the Book of Order, and in 2011, the Presbyteries of the PC(USA) passed Amendment 10-A permitting congregations to ordain elders and deacons and presbyteries to ordain ministers without reference to the fidelity/chastity provision, saying &quot;governing bodies shall be guided by Scripture and the confessions in applying standards to individual candidates&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcusa.org/news/2011/5/10/churchwide-letter-concerning-amendment-10-/ |title= A churchwide letter concerning Amendment 10-A| publisher= PC (USA) | date= 2011‐5‐10 |accessdate= 2012-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 2012, [[The Fellowship of Presbyterians]] gathered to create a &quot;New Reformed Body,&quot; an alternative denomination to which congregations disaffected by the change in ordination standards could transfer their membership.  In the New Reformed Body, congregations own their own property, rather than the denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fellowship-pres.org/ |title=The Fellowship of Presbyterians | accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Presbyterian scholars, pastors, and theologians have been heavily involved in the debate over homosexuality. In 2005, a female minister in Pennsylvania came under scrutiny after performing a marriage between a lesbian couple, including some Buddhist rites in the ceremony. Her case is to be heard by the [[ecclesiastical court|church's court]]. Officially, the church does not prohibit clergy-performed blessing ceremonies for same sex unions, as long as it is clear that the blessing ritual is not a marriage ceremony.

Since 1980, the [[More Light Churches Network]] has served many congregations and individuals within American Presbyterianism who promote the full participation of all people in the PC(USA) regardless of sexual identity or lifestyle. The Covenant Network of Presbyterians was formed in 1997 to support repeal of &quot;Amendment B&quot;, and to encourage networking amongst like-minded clergy and congregations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.covenantnetwork.org/about06.htm | title = About | publisher = Covenant Network}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations of Presbyterians, such as the [[Confessing Movement]] and the [[Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals]], have also organized on the other side of the issue to support the fidelity/chastity standard for ordination.

===General Assembly 2006===

The 2006 ''Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcusa.org/peaceunitypurity/finalreport/final-report-revised-english.pdf A Season of Discernment: The Final Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church], Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), 2006, retrieved 2008-05-14&lt;/ref&gt; in theory, attempted to find common ground. Some felt that the adoption of this report provided for a clear local option mentioned, while the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Clifton Kirkpatrick went on record as saying, &quot;Our standards have not changed. The rules of the Book of Order stay in force and all ordinations are still subject to review by higher governing bodies.&quot; The authors of the report stated that it is a compromise and return to the original Presbyterian culture of local controls. The recommendation for more control by local [[presbyterian polity|presbyteries and sessions]] is viewed by its opposition as a method for bypassing the constitutional restrictions currently in place concerning ordination and marriage, effectively making the constitutional &quot;standard&quot; entirely subjective. 

In the General Assembly gathering of June 2006, Presbyterian voting Commissioners passed an &quot;authoritative interpretation&quot;, recommended by the Theological Task Force, of the ''Book of Order'' (the church constitution). Some argued that this gave presbyteries the &quot;local option&quot; of ordaining or not ordaining anyone based on a particular presbytery's reading of the constitutional statute. Others argued that presbyteries have always had this responsibility and that this new ruling did not change but only clarified that responsibility. On June 20, 2006, the General Assembly voted 298 to 221 (or 57% to 43%) to approve such interpretation. In that same session on June 20, the General Assembly also voted 405 to 92 (with 4 abstentions) to uphold the constitutional standard for ordination requiring fidelity in marriage or chastity in singleness. A clear understanding of the effect of what the General Assembly voted upon in 2006 may have to wait until the ecclesiastical courts make decisions on specific cases.

===General Assembly 2008===

The General Assembly of 2008 took several actions related to homosexuality. The first action was to adopt a different translation of the [[Heidelberg Catechism]] from 1962, removing the words &quot;homosexual perversions&quot; among other changes. This will require the approval of the 2010 and 2012 General Assemblies as well as the votes of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly.{{Update after | 2010 | 6 | 30}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pc-biz.org/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=1699 | publisher = General Assembly PC-Biz system | title = 218th General Assembly | at = item 13-06}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second action was to approve a new Authoritative Interpretation of G-6.0108 of the ''Book of Order'' allowing for the ordaining body to make decisions on whether or not a departure from the standards of belief of practice is sufficient to preclude ordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pc-biz.org/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=1497 | publisher = General Assembly PC-Biz system | title = 218th General Assembly | at = item 05-12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some argue that this creates &quot;local option&quot; on ordaining homosexual persons.  The third action was to replace the text of &quot;Amendment B&quot; with new text: &quot;Those who are called to ordained service in the church, by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation (W-4.4003), pledge themselves to live lives obedient to Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures through the instruction of the Confessions. In so doing, they declare their fidelity to the standards of the Church. Each governing body charged with examination for ordination and/or installation (G-14.0240 and G-14.0450) establishes the candidate's sincere efforts to adhere to these standards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pc-biz.org/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=1461 | publisher = General Assembly PC-Biz system | title = 218th General Assembly | at = item 05-09}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This would have removed the &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; clause. This third action failed to obtain the required  approval of a majority of the presbyteries by June, 2009.  Fourth, a resolution was adopted to affirm the definition of marriage from Scripture and the Confessions as being between a man and a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/ga218/ | publisher = PC(USA) | title = 218th General Assembly | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Assembly 2010===

In July, 2010, by a vote of 373 to 323, the General Assembly voted to propose to the presbyteries for ratification a constitutional amendment to remove from the Book of Order section G-6.0106.b. which included this explicit requirement for ordination: “Among these standards is the requirement to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (W-4.9001), or chastity in singleness.” This proposal required ratification by a majority of the 173 presbyteries within 12 months of the General Assembly’s adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url= http://www.christianpost.com/article/20100709/pcusa-assembly-oks-removing-gay-ordination-ban/ |title= PCUSA Assembly OKs Lifting Gay Ordination Ban, Christian News | journal = Christian post |date= 2010-07-09 |accessdate = 2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2011/05/10/Presbyterians_Approve_Gay_Clergy/ | newspaper = Advocate | title = Presbyterians approve gay clergy | date = 2011‐5‐10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of presbytery votes was reached in May, 2011. The constitutional amendment took effect July 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/us/11presbyterian.html?_r=3 | title = Presbyterians Approve Ordination of Gay People | date = 2011‐5‐11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This amendment shifted back to the ordaining body the responsibility for making decisions about whom they shall ordain and what they shall require of their candidates for ordination. It neither prevents nor imposes the use of the so-called “fidelity and chastity” requirement, but it removes that decision from the text of the constitution and places that judgment responsibility back upon the ordaining body where it had traditionally been prior to the insertion of the former G-6.0106.b. in 1997. Each ordaining body is now responsible to make its own interpretation of what scripture and the confessions require of ordained officers. 

At the General Assembly of 2004 an overture to consider adoption of the [[Belhar Confession]] was adopted. That confession was written by the [[Dutch Reformed Mission Church in South Africa]] in response to [[apartheid]]. The 2008 General Assembly voted to create a committee to study the confession and bring a recommendation to the 2010 General Assembly. This is the first step in the PC(USA) process of changing the ''[[Book of Confessions]]'', a process that will require approval at General Assemblies in 2010 and 2012 and approval of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly.{{Update after | 2009 | 6 | 30}}

===Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians===

[[Image:ECO Logo.jpg|thumb|alt=The Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians.|The ECO logo]]
{{Main|Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians}}
A new denomination was formed by some members of the PC(USA) in 2012, called The [[Evangelical Covenant Order of Presbyterians]], or ECO.  A gathering of over 2,100 members of the PC(USA) representing over 500 churches gathered in Orlando to form a denomination that sought to be free from ongoing decline, conflict, and increasingly liberal theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fellowship-pres.org/ |title=The Fellowship of Presbyterians |publisher=Fellowship-pres.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ECO affirms the ordination of women while maintaining that ordained officers of the church are to remain faithful within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or chaste in singleness.  It also affirms that Jesus Christ is the only way to God's salvation.

As of May 2013, ECO reported that 53 congregations totaling over 18,000 members had joined the new denomination. Most of these congregations are former PC(USA) members

===Property ownership===
In the event of a congregational split, dissolution (closing), or disassociation from the PC(USA), the presbytery may assert a claim to the property. State law (which varies) determines the ownership of property despite the denomination's property clause in the ''Book of Order''. This clause does not prevent particular churches from leaving the denomination, but if they do, they may not be entitled to any physical assets of that congregation unless by agreement with the presbytery. Recently this provision has been vigorously tested in courts of law.

Despite the historically connectional structure of Presbyterianism, this issue is, surprisingly, relatively new. Until recently the &quot;connection&quot; referred to doctrinal coherence and had no reference to physical property. In 1981, UPCUSA leaders persuaded the General Assembly to amend the ''Book of Order'' in order to add the &quot;property trust&quot; elements. The denomination did this in reaction to three developments over the previous decade:

1) A case involving a [[Pittsburgh]] ministerial candidate who opposed the ordination of women led several congregations in western [[Pennsylvania]] and eastern [[Ohio]] to leave in favor of the new [[Presbyterian Church in America]], a conservative body with origins in the [[Southern U.S.]], in the mid-1970s.

2) The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Jones v. Wolf]]'', {{ussc|443|595|1979}}, allowed for church property cases to be adjudicated in civil courts in the U.S., giving churches hostile to national or regional bodies a possible platform to secede.

3) Some months prior to that General Assembly, a number of disaffected congregations formed a new conservative denomination, the [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church (United States)|Evangelical Presbyterian Church]]. UPCUSA loyalists interpreted that move as having been encouraged by the 1979 ruling.

The secessions in the first and third points were occasioned in part by factors including the UPCUSA's approval of [[abortion rights]], its stands on [[world peace]] and concomitant suspicion of an aggressive U.S. foreign policy (brought about by the trauma of the [[Vietnam War]]), and its support of controversial social justice causes such as a well-publicized General Assembly contribution to the defense fund of imprisoned activist [[Angela Davis]]. The first instance in particular reflected that candidate's and those churches' opposition to female leadership in the church and [[feminism]] in general. Later, in the 1980s, Presbyterian evangelicals added [[homosexuality]] to their list of grievances, although the UPCUSA decided in 1978 not to ordain non-celibate gays to the ministry or eldership, a decision that liberal groups succeeded in reversing in 2011.

The PCUS, already deeply in preparation for the UPCUSA merger, followed suit in 1982, but managed to gain a concession for its conservative congregations in the form of a two-year grace period to take effect after the consummation of the merger, to enable dissenting churches to defect, by consent of presbytery, without suffering any loss of assets. The PCUS had to agree to this limit on eligibility as a condition of union, due to the so-called &quot;Northern Presbyterians&quot; being by far the majority numerically.

In ensuing years, disaffection has grown among PC(USA) conservatives (from both predecessor traditions) due to feelings that presbyteries have no right to congregational property, since national agencies and local pledges usually finance building programs, with little or no presbytery fiduciary interest. In fact, prior to World War II, more often than not, new churches started from the initiative of larger congregations (e.g., Sunday School missions), not presbyteries, as became the case increasingly from the 1950s onward, due to suburban mission planning and ecumenical concerns. Several cases in [[California]] seem to have halted the practice in that state—the courts have allowed individual churches to leave the PC(USA) and keep their own assets, as well as parishes of the United Methodist and Episcopal denominations. State courts have varied as to whether they grant property to congregations or presbyteries in disputes, with states like Louisiana and Kansas deferring to local congregations.

In 2006, a few top staff in the national denominational offices (two attorneys named, the Clerk suggested by role in the exposé article cited below; none of those staff still serve in those offices) produced documents labelled &quot;Privileged and Confidential Attorney Work Communication&quot; recommending that presbyteries use &quot;spiritual language&quot; in defending property rights and assuming a defensive posture, obligating congregations to file suit.  The so-called &quot;Louisville Papers&quot; caused a firestorm of controversy when they were exposed and publicly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.layman.org/Home/Property_issues/The_Louisville_papers.aspx |title=PCUSA documents on property: 'true church' vs. 'schismatics' |publisher=The Layman |date=2006-08-09 |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divestment from corporations operating in Israel===
{{Main|PC(USA) Divestment from Israel}}
{{See also|Disinvestment from Israel}}
In June 2004, the General Assembly met in [[Richmond, Virginia]] and adopted by a vote of 431-62 a resolution that called on the church's committee on Mission Responsibility through Investment (MRTI) &quot;to initiate a process of phased, [[selective divestment]] in multinational corporations operating in Israel.&quot; The resolution also said &quot;the occupation… has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict.&quot;&lt;ref name='Overture 04-32'&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pcusa.org/ga216/business/overtures/ovt0432.htm |title=Urging Israel and Palestine to Implement the Accord |accessdate=2007-02-09 |date=2004-06-26 |publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church statement at the time noted that &quot;divestment is one of the strategies that U.S. churches used in the 1970s and 80s in a successful campaign to end [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]].&quot; 

A second resolution, calling for an end to the construction of a wall by the state of Israel, passed.&lt;ref name='Israeli Wall'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pcusa.org/worldwide/israelpalestine/wallresolution.htm |title=General Assembly Action on the Israeli Wall |accessdate= 2007-02-09 |date= 2004-06-26 |publisher=[[Presbyterian Church (USA)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution opposed to the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction.  The General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting [[Christian Zionism]] and allowing the continued funding of [[Jews for Jesus|conversionary activities aimed at Jews]]. Together, the resolutions caused tremendous dissent within the church and a sharp disconnect with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter Regarding Divestment sent to Mainline Protestant Denominations From Leaders of Five Major Jewish Organizations|url= http://www.globalministries.org/mee/jointsanctions.pdf |format= PDF|publisher=American Jewish Committee, Anti-Defamation League, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Union for Reform Judaism, United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism | first1 = David | last1 = Elcott | first2 = Rabbi Gary | last2 = Bretton-Granatoor | first3 = Ethan | last3 = Felson | first4 = Mark | last4 = Waldman | first5 = Mark | last5 = Pelavin|date= November 29, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presbyterians Bearing False Witness|url= http://americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5546 |publisher=The American Thinker | last =Appelbaum | first = Diana|date= June 3, 2006|accessdate= June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presbyterian Church defames Christianity |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0704/prager_presbyterians.php3|publisher=Jewish World Review | last =Prager | first = Dennis|date=July 20, 2004|accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= The Presbyterian Church Boycotts Israel | url = http://www.jewishmag.com/94mag/presbyterian/presbyterian.htm|publisher=The Jewish Magazine| last =Hecht | first = Shea|month=September | year= 2005 | accessdate=June 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://expresbyterian.blogspot.com/2007/12/curious-silence.html | title = A Recovering Presbyterian | contribution = A Curious Silence | year = 2007 | month = 12 | publisher = Google}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, after the General Assembly in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] changed policy ([[PC(USA) Divestment from Israel#Change to policy in 2006|details]]), both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups praised the resolution. Pro-Israel groups, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from 12 National Jewish Agencies to Presbyterian Church USA General Assembly Commissioners Regarding Upcoming Decision on Phased Selective Divestment Related to Israel|url=http://www.adl.org/Interfaith/Letter_commissioners.asp|author=Rabbi Gary Bretton-Granatoor, Dr. David Elcott, Ethan Felson, Lewis Grafman, Shelley Klein, Dr. Eugene Korn, Avram Lyons, David Michaels, Sammie Moshenberg, Mark Pelavin, Dr. Carl Sheingold, Robert Zweiman|date=June 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement from 15 National Agencies Welcoming Presbyterian Church USA General Assembly Return to &quot;Customary Corporate Engagement Process&quot; |author=Ethan Felson|url=http://www.e-guana.net/organizations/org/JointStatementpostPCGA2006.doc |date=June 4, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Palestinian groups said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process.

Ahead of its scheduled July 2012 General Assembly meeting, there is talk that this issue will be raised again. According to an article in the [[Jewish Week]], &quot;several observers said, however, that they believe the church laity will similarly reject this proposal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | journal = The Jewish week | url = http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/new_york/presbyterians_again_debate_divestment_israel | title = Presbyterians To Again Debate Divestment From Israel}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the group Presbyterians for Middle East Peace has issued a statement against the divestment vote as well, saying, &quot;We are not surprised by the MRTI recommendation because there is a small group of activists within the PCUSA that has relentlessly sought to punish Israel. Wanting to find one party at fault in a conflict where all parties have engaged in positive and negative actions, this small group believes that Israel is solely to blame for the current conflict.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Religion news | url = http://www.religionnews.com/index.php?/pressreleases/presbyterians_reject_call_for_divestment/ | title = Presbyterians Reject Call for Divestment}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the American National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus (NMEPC) endorsed the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|boycott, divestment, and sanctions]] (BDS) campaign against Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Religion news | url = http://www.religionnews.com/index.php?/pressreleases/nmepc_support_boycott_campaign_against_the_israeli_occupation_of_palestine/ | title = National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus Supports and Endorses the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Campaign Against the Israeli Occupation of Palestine}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revision of Interfaith Relations resource on church anti-Jewish bias in materials related to Israeli-Palestinian conflict===
In May 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ccjr.us/dialogika-resources/documents-and-statements/protestant-churches/na/presbyterian/689-pcusa08may | publisher = Council on Centers on Jewish-Christian Relations | title = PCUSA-OIR Statement}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the denomination's Office of Interfaith Relations issued a statement titled &quot;Vigilance against anti-Jewish ideas and bias.&quot; This statement reported that &quot;strains of an old anti-Jewish tradition are present in the way we ourselves sometimes speak and in the rhetoric and ideas of some writers that we may read&quot; regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.pcusa.org/interfaith/vigilance.htm | title = Vigilance against anti-Jewish ideas and bias | publisher = Office of Interfaith Relations, [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] | accessdate = 2008-05-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Church revised and expanded this document in June, removing acknowledgment of such sentiment as a matter of current church practice, instead declaring that the church's current stands are not anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish — in part because they reflect criticisms of Israel meted by Jews and Israelis. The revisions resulted in a rebuke from the major Jewish denominations in a June 13, 2008 letter to the head of the PCUSA &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = URJ | url = http://urj.org/pr/2008/presbyterian_jewish_relations/ | title = Letter from Jewish Denomination Leaders to Stated Clerk Kirkpatrick | date = June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar condemnation in the form of a statement from the denominations and ten other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://tools.isovera.com/organizations.php3?action=printContentItem&amp;orgid=54&amp;typeID=78&amp;itemID=22388&amp;User_Session=bdb00e9acf93e30cfc7b787655b302ba | publisher = Jewish Agency Statement | title = PCUSA Revisions to anti-Jewish bias document | date = June 13, 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''piña colada''' (Spanish: ''piña'', pineapple + ''colada'', strained) is a sweet, [[rum]]-based [[cocktail]] made with rum, [[cream of coconut]], and [[pineapple juice]], usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with a pineapple wedge, a [[maraschino cherry]] or both. The piña colada has been the official beverage of [[Puerto Rico]] since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hotels.about.com/b/a/104906.htm| title=Celebrate Two of Mankind's Greatest Inventions| accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
On August 16, 1954 at the [[Caribe Hilton Hotel|Caribe Hilton]]'s Beachcomber Bar in San Juan, Puerto Rico by its alleged creator, Ramón &quot;Monchito&quot; Marrero. Apparently, the hotel management had requested Monchito to mix a signature drink; after three months of experimenting the first piña colada was born.

==Popularity==
This cocktail has been famous in Puerto Rico since 1978, and it became more widely known after [[Rupert Holmes]] released his song &quot;[[Escape (Rupert Holmes song)|Escape]]&quot;, commonly known as &quot;The Piña Colada Song&quot;. &lt;!-- It was also Del Boy's favourite drink in Only Fools And Horses --&gt;

==Preparation==
There are many recipes of how to make a piña colada but the one that his friends tell in the book of José L. Díaz De Villegas to be the original recipe created by Monchito, is the following:
Pour 3 ounces of coconut cream, 6 ounces of pineapple juice and 1{{fraction|1|2}} ounces of white rum into a [[blender]] or shaker with crushed ice, and blend or shake very well until smooth. Pour into chilled glass, garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry.

==Variations==
* Different proportions may be used. For example, 1 part rum, 2 each of pineapple juice and coconut cream.
* Dark rum may be used.
* Amaretto colada — [[amaretto]] substituted for rum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartender.com/2calendar/cal-2003/cal-0603.htm| title=Frozen/Mixed — Amaretto Colada| accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lava Flow — strawberry [[daiquiri]] and piña colada blended together&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gohawaii.about.com/od/drinks/r/lava_flow.htm| title=Lava Flow| accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PackBits''' is a fast, simple [[Lossless data compression|lossless compression]] scheme for [[run-length encoding]] of data.

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced the PackBits format with the release of [[MacPaint]] on the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computer. This compression scheme is one of the types of compression that can be used in [[TIFF]]-files. [[Truevision TGA|TGA]]-files also use this RLE compression scheme, but treats data stream as pixels instead of bytes.

A PackBits data stream consists of packets with a one-byte header followed by data. The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or packed (such as &lt;nowiki&gt;MacPaint&lt;/nowiki&gt; pixels).

In the following table, ''n'' is the value of the header byte as a signed integer.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header byte || Data following the header byte
|-
| 0 to 127 || (1 + ''n'') [[literal (computer programming)|literal]] bytes of data
|-
| -1 to -127 || One byte of data, repeated (1 &amp;ndash; ''n'') times in the decompressed output
|-
| -128 || No operation (skip and treat next byte as a header byte)
|-
|}
Note that interpreting 0 as positive or negative makes no difference in the output. Runs of two bytes adjacent to non-runs are typically written as literal data.  It should also be noted that there is no way based on the PackBits data to determine the end of the data stream; that is to say, one must already know the size of the compressed or uncompressed data before reading a PackBits data stream to know where it ends.

Apple Computer (see the external link) provides this short example of packed data:
&lt;code&gt;FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA&lt;/code&gt;

The following code, written in Microsoft VBA, unpacks the data:
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Sub UnpackBitsDemo()
   Dim File As Variant
   Dim MyOutput As String
   Dim Count As Long
   Dim i As Long, j As Long
  
   File = &quot;FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA&quot;
   File = Split(File, &quot; &quot;)
   
   For i = LBound(File) To UBound(File)
      Count = Application.WorksheetFunction.Hex2Dec(File(i))
      Select Case Count
      Case Is &gt;= 128
         Count = 256 - Count 'Two's Complement
         For j = 0 To Count 'zero-based
            MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + 1) &amp; &quot; &quot;
         Next j
         i = i + 1 'Adjust the pointer
      Case Else
         For j = 0 To Count 'zero-based
            MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + j + 1) &amp; &quot; &quot;
         Next j
         i = i + j 'Adjust the pointer
      End Select
   Next i

   Debug.Print MyOutput
   'AA AA AA 80 00 2A AA AA AA AA 80 00 2A 22 AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA'
End Sub
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Pub rock''' is a style of [[Australia]]n [[rock and roll]] popular throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and still influencing contemporary [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] today.

The term came from the venues where most of these bands originally played — inner-city and suburban [[Australian pubs|pubs]]. These often noisy, hot, and crowded establishments were largely frequented by men and women in their late teenage years and 20s. &quot;Pubs&quot; originally come from England and the concept spread due to British settlers in colonies such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada.

== Origins ==

The emergence of 'pub rock' and the pub circuit in Australia was the result of several interconnected factors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, mainly because of restrictive state liquor licensing laws, only a small proportion of live pop-rock music in Australia was performed on licensed premises (mostly private clubs or [[discotheques]]); the majority of concerts were held in non-licensed venues like community, church or municipal halls. These concerts and dances were 'all-ages' events—often with adult supervision—and alcohol was not served. 

During the 1960s, however, Australian states began liberalizing their licensing laws. [[Sunday Observance Act (disambiguation)|Sunday Observance Act]]s were repealed, pub opening hours were extended, discriminatory regulations — such as the long-standing ban on women entering or drinking in public bars — were removed, and in the 1970s the age of legal majority was lowered from 21 to 18.

Concurrently, the members of the so-called &quot;[[Baby Boomer]]&quot; generation  — who were the main audience for pop and rock music — were reaching their late teens and early twenties, and were thus able to enter licensed premises. Pub owners soon realized that providing live music (which was often free) would draw young people to pubs in large numbers, and regular rock concerts soon became a fixture at many pubs. 

Many city and suburban pubs gained renown for their support of live music, and many prominent Australian bands — including [[AC/DC]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]] and [[The Dingoes]] — cut their teeth at these venues in the early days of their careers. Notable pub-rock venues include the [[Largs Pier Hotel]] and the [[Governor Hindmarsh Hotel]] in Adelaide, the [[Royal Antler Hotel]] in [[Narrabeen]], Sydney and the [[Civic Hotel]] in Sydney's city centre, the famous Star Hotel in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle NSW]] and the [[Station Hotel, Prahran|Station Hotel]] in [[Prahran]], Melbourne, which was one of the premier pub-rock venues in Australia for more than two decades, [[Poyntons Carlton Club Hotel]] in [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]] Melbourne's first Sunday night Live pub-rock venue.

As the pub-rock phenomenon expanded, hundreds of pubs in capital cities and major towns began providing regular live music, and a thriving circuit evolved, enabling bands to tour up and down the eastern and southern coast of Australia from North Queensland to South Australia. 

It could be argued that the very venues many of the bands played in (pubs), had a major influence on the evolution of their music and sound. The venues were more often than not small and the crowds — alcohol-fuelled — were there for the experience rather than to see a &quot;name band&quot;. Thus, an emphasis on simple, rhythm-based songs grew. With the sound in many of the rooms far from ideal for live music, an emphasis on a very loud snare and kick-drum and driving bass-guitar grew. Guitarists tended to rely on simple, repetitive riffs, rather than more complex solos or counter-melodies. This might explain why, even in studios and larger arenas and stadiums, many of the bands who cut their teeth in pubs still relied on an exaggerated drum sound and fairly simple musical arrangements.

A band like [[Hunters &amp; Collectors]], for example, saw their sound harden from their arty origins (which included a brass-section, experimental percussion and complex arrangements) to a more straightforward rock sound with emphasis on drums, bass and simple guitar riffs; a sound that more suited the beer barns they were to play in over their extensive touring career.

Though Australia has a small population, the sheer number of venues that bands could play in, mainly along the Eastern coast, meant that a band could tour extensively, often playing every night for long periods. This would allow bands such as [[AC/DC]], [[Cold Chisel]], [[INXS]], [[Midnight Oil]] plus many others to take their well-honed live skills into large venues in the US and Europe with ease.

The [[Screaming Jets]] have the unenviable title of the &quot;Kings of the Sticky Carpet&quot; regarding the volume of gigs performed in venues (pubs) which had carpet floors that had alcohol, sweat and vomit spilt over it on a regular basis.

== Changes ==

Changes to entertainment options have to a large extent ended the tradition of [[Australian pub]] Rock as a viable circuit. The increasing fragmentation of popular music and the growing popularity of dance music and the DJ pheonmenon have reduced the interest in 'traditional' rock/pop entertainment.

Sydney in particular has seen many staple live music venues close, falling victim to increasing rents in gentrified areas, noise restrictions imposed by local governments in response to local residents' demands; the popularity of the DJ and dance music; and the supposedly greater profitability of [[Slot machine|poker machines]]. As it turned out, these poker machines were not nearly as popular as expected, and in recent times a number of pubs have resumed hosting live bands.

Melbourne, too, has lost venues, including the [[Continental Cafe|Continental]] in Prahran and the [[Punters Club]] in Fitzroy.
The newer generation of bands that could be considered the followers of the Pub Rock tradition includes: [[Airbourne (band)|Airbourne]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[The Living End]], [[Magic Dirt]], and [[You Am I]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The term '''''phonation''''' has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of [[phonetics]].  Among some phoneticians, ''phonation'' is the process by which the [[vocal folds]] produce certain sounds through quasi-periodic vibration. This is the definition used among those who study [[larynx|laryngeal]] anatomy and physiology and speech production in general. Other phoneticians, though, call this process ''[[voice (phonetics)|voicing]]'', and they use the term ''phonation'' to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the [[larynx]] that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example. As such, voiceless and supra-glottal phonation are included under this definition, which is common in the field of linguistic phonetics.

==Voicing==
The phonatory process, or voicing, occurs when air is expelled from the lungs through the [[glottis]], creating a pressure drop across the larynx.  When this drop becomes sufficiently large, the vocal folds start to oscillate.  The minimum pressure drop required to achieve phonation is called the phonation threshold pressure, and for humans with normal vocal folds, it is approximately 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  The motion of the vocal folds during oscillation is mostly lateral, though there is also some superior component as well.  However, there is almost no motion along the length of the vocal folds.  The oscillation of the vocal folds serves to modulate the pressure and flow of the air through the larynx, and this modulated airflow is the main component of the sound of most [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[Phone (phonetics)|phones]].

The sound that the larynx produces is a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. In other words, it consists of a fundamental tone (called the fundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept [[Pitch (psychophysics)|pitch]]) accompanied by harmonic overtones, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I. R. (2008). The human instrument. Sci.Am. 298 (1):94-101. PM 18225701&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall (currently published by NCVS.org), ISBN 978-0-13-717893-3.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Source-Filter Theory, the resulting sound excites the resonance chamber that is the [[vocal tract]] to produce the individual speech sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lieberman&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The vocal folds will not oscillate if they are not sufficiently close to one another, are not under sufficient tension or under too much tension, or if the pressure drop across the larynx is not sufficiently large. In linguistics, a [[Phone (phonetics)|phone]] is called [[Voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] if there is no phonation during its occurrence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greene&quot;/&gt;  In speech, voiceless phones are associated with vocal folds that are elongated, highly tensed, and placed laterally (abducted) when compared to vocal folds during phonation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zemlin&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| last = Zemlin

Fundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept ''pitch'', can be varied through a variety of means. Large scale changes are accomplished by increasing the tension in the vocal folds through contraction of the cricothyroid muscle. Smaller changes in tension can be effected by contraction of the thyroarytenoid muscle or changes in the relative position of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as may occur when the larynx is lowered or raised, either volitionally or through movement of the tongue to which the larynx is attached via the hyoid bone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zemlin&quot;/&gt;  In addition to tension changes, fundamental frequency is also affected by the pressure drop across the larynx, which is mostly affected by the pressure in the lungs, and will also vary with the distance between the vocal folds. Variation in fundamental frequency is used linguistically to produce [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

There are currently two main theories as to how vibration of the [[vocal folds]] is initiated: the '''myoelastic theory''' and the '''aerodynamic theory'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Titze, I. R. 2006&quot;&gt;Titze, I. R. (2006).The Myoelastic Aerodynamic Theory of Phonation, Iowa City:National Center for Voice and Speech, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These two theories are not in contention with one another and it is quite possible that both theories are true and operating simultaneously to initiate and maintain vibration. A third theory, the '''neurochronaxic theory''', was in considerable vogue in the 1950s, but has since been largely discredited.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinney&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| title = The Diagnosis and Correction of Vocal Faults
| last = McKinney
| first = James
| year = 1994
| publisher = Genovex Music Group
| isbn =  978-1-56593-940-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Myoelastic and aerodynamic theory===
The myoelastic theory states that when the [[vocal cords]] are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them, the cords remain closed until the pressure beneath them—the subglottic pressure—is sufficient to push them apart, allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again.  Pressure builds up once again until the cords are pushed apart, and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself.  The rate at which the cords open and close—the number of cycles per second—determines the pitch of the phonation.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinney&quot;/&gt;

The aerodynamic theory is based on the [[Bernoulli's principle|Bernoulli energy law in fluids]]. The theory states that when a stream of breath is flowing through the [[glottis]] while the arytenoid cartilages are held together by the action of the interarytenoid muscles, a push-pull effect is created on the vocal fold tissues that maintains self-sustained oscillation. The push occurs during glottal opening, when the glottis is convergent, whereas the pull occurs during glottal closing, when the glottis is divergent. During glottal closure, the air flow is cut off until breath pressure pushes the folds apart and the flow starts up again, causing the cycles to repeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinney&quot;/&gt;
The textbook entitled [[Myoelastic Aerodynamic Theory of Phonation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Titze, I. R. 2006&quot;/&gt; by [[Ingo Titze]] credits Janwillem van den Berg as the originator of the theory and provides detailed mathematical development of the theory.

===Neurochronaxic theory===
This theory states that the frequency of the vocal fold vibration is determined by the chronaxy of the recurrent nerve, and not by breath pressure or muscular tension.  Advocates of this theory thought that every single vibration of the vocal folds was due to an impulse from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and that the acoustic center in the brain regulated the speed of vocal fold vibration.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinney&quot;/&gt;  Speech and voice scientists have long since left this theory as the muscles have been shown to not be able to contract fast enough to accomplish the vibration.  In addition, persons with paralyzed vocal folds can produce phonation, which would not be possible according to this theory.  Phonation occurring in excised larynges would also not be possible according to this theory.

==State of the glottis==
[[Image:Glottis positions.png|thumb|A continuum from closed glottis to open. The black triangles represent the arytenoid cartilages, the sail shapes the vocal cords, and the dotted circle the windpipe.]]

In linguistic phonetic treatments of phonation, such as those of [[Peter Ladefoged]], phonation was considered to be a matter of points on a continuum of tension and closure of the vocal cords. More intricate mechanisms were occasionally described, but they were difficult to investigate, and until recently the state of the glottis and phonation were considered to be nearly synonymous.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;&gt;{{SOWL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the vocal cords are completely relaxed, with the arytenoid cartilages apart for maximum airflow, the cords do not vibrate. This is '''voiceless''' phonation, and is extremely common with [[obstruent]]s. If the arytenoids are pressed together for '''glottal closure''', the vocal cords block the airstream, producing stop sounds such as the [[glottal stop]]. In between there is a '''sweet spot''' of maximum vibration. This is [[modal voice]], and is the normal state for vowels and [[sonorant]]s in all the world's languages. However, the aperture of the arytenoid cartilages, and therefore the tension in the vocal cords, is one of degree between the end points of open and closed, and there are several intermediate situations utilized by various languages to make contrasting sounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

For example, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] has vowels with a partially lax phonation called '''[[breathy voice]]''' or '''murmured''', while [[Burmese language|Burmese]] has vowels with a partially tense phonation called '''[[creaky voice]]''' or '''laryngealized'''. Both of these phonations have dedicated IPA diacritics, an under-umlaut and under-tilde. The Jalapa dialect of [[Mazateco|Mazatec]] is unusual in contrasting both with modal voice in a three-way distinction. (Note that Mazatec is a tonal language, so the glottis is making several tonal distinctions simultaneously with the phonation distinctions.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| ||colspan=2|'''Mazatec'''
|-
| '''breathy voice''' || {{IPA|[ja̤]}} || ''he wears''
|-
| '''modal voice''' || {{IPA|[já]}} || ''tree''
|-
| '''creaky voice''' || {{IPA|[ja̰]}} || ''he carries''
|}
:''Note: There was an editing error in the source of this information. The latter two translations may have been mixed up.''

[[Javanese language|Javanese]] does not have modal voice in its [[stop consonant|stop]]s, but contrasts two other points along the phonation scale, with more moderate departures from modal voice, called [[slack voice]] and [[stiff voice]]. The &quot;muddy&quot; consonants in [[Shanghainese (dialect)|Shanghainese]] are slack voice; they contrast with tenuis and aspirated consonants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

Although each language may be somewhat different, it is convenient to classify these degrees of phonation into discrete categories. A series of seven alveolar stops, with phonations ranging from an open/lax to a closed/tense glottis, are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|'''Open glottis'''||{{IPA|[t]}}||''[[voiceless]]'' (full airstream)
|-
| ||{{IPA|[d̤]}}||''[[breathy voice]]''
|-
| ||{{IPA|[d̥]}}||''[[slack voice]]''
|-
|'''Sweet spot'''||{{IPA|[d]}}||''[[Voice (phonetics)|modal voice]]'' (maximum vibration)
|-
| ||{{IPA|[d̬]}}||''[[stiff voice]]''
|-
| ||{{IPA|[d̰]}}||''[[creaky voice]]''
|-
|'''Closed glottis'''||{{IPA|[ʔ͡t]}}||''glottal closure'' (blocked airstream)
|}

The IPA diacritics ''under-ring'' and ''subscript wedge'', commonly called &quot;voiceless&quot; and &quot;voiced&quot;, are sometimes added to the symbol for a voiced sound to indicate more lax/open (slack) and tense/closed (stiff) states of the glottis, respectively. (Ironically, adding the 'voicing' diacritic to the symbol for a voiced consonant indicates ''less'' modal voicing, not more, because a modally voiced sound is already fully voiced, at its sweet spot, and any further tension in the vocal cords dampens their vibration.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

[[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], like several Germanic languages, has a typologically unusual phonation in its stops. The consonants transcribed {{IPA|/b̥/, /d̥/, /ɡ̊/}} (ambiguously called &quot;lenis&quot;) are partially voiced: The vocal cords are positioned as for voicing, but do not actually vibrate. That is, they are technically voiceless, but without the open glottis usually associated with voiceless stops. They contrast with both modally voiced {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} and modally voiceless {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} in French borrowings, as well as aspirated {{IPA|/kʰ/}} word initially.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

===Glottal consonants===
It has long been noted that in many languages, both phonologically and historically, the [[glottal consonant]]s {{IPA|[ʔ, ɦ, h]}} do not behave like other consonants. Phonetically, they have no [[manner of articulation|manner]] or [[place of articulation]] other than the state of the glottis: ''glottal closure'' for {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, ''breathy voice'' for {{IPA|[ɦ]}}, and ''open airstream'' for {{IPA|[h]}}. Some phoneticians have described these sounds as neither glottal nor consonantal, but instead as instances of pure phonation, at least in many European languages. However, in [[Semitic languages]] they do appear to be true glottal consonants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ladefoged&quot;/&gt;

==Supra-glottal phonation==
In the last few decades it has become apparent that phonation may involve the entire larynx, with as many as six valves and muscles working either independently or together. From the glottis upward, these articulations are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmondson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

#[[glottis|glottal]] (the vocal cords), producing the distinctions described above
#[[Ventricle of the larynx|ventricular]] (the 'false vocal cords', partially covering and damping the glottis)
#[[arytenoid muscle|arytenoid]] ([[sphincteric compression]] forwards and upwards)
#[[Epiglotto-pharyngeal consonant|epiglotto-pharyngeal]] (retraction of the tongue and [[epiglottis]], potentially closing onto the pharyngeal wall)
#raising or lowering of the entire [[larynx]]
#narrowing of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]]

Until the development of [[fiber optics|fiber-optic]] [[laryngoscopy]], the full involvement of the larynx during speech production was not observable, and the interactions among the six laryngeal articulators is still poorly understood. However, at least two supra-glottal phonations appear to be widespread in the world's languages. These are [[harsh voice]] ('ventricular' or 'pressed' voice), which involves overall constriction of the larynx, and [[faucalized voice]] ('hollow' or 'yawny' voice), which involves overall expansion of the larynx.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmondson&quot;/&gt;

The Bor dialect of [[Dinka language|Dinka]] has contrastive modal, breathy, faucalized, and harsh voice in its vowels, as well as three tones. The ''ad hoc'' diacritics employed in the literature are a subscript double quotation mark for faucalized voice, {{IPA|[a͈]}}, and underlining for harsh voice, {{IPA|[a̱]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmondson&quot;/&gt; Examples are,

{| class=wikitable
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
!Voice!!modal!!breathy!!harsh!!faucalized
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
|'''Bor Dinka'''||{{IPA|tɕìt}}||{{IPA|tɕì̤t}}||{{IPA|tɕì̱t}}||{{IPA|tɕì͈t}}
|- align=&quot;center&quot;
| ||''diarrhea''||''go ahead''||''scorpions''||''to swallow''
|}

Other languages with these contrasts are [[Bai language|Bai]] (modal, breathy, and harsh voice), [[Grũsi languages|Kabiye]] (faucalized and harsh voice, previously seen as [[Advanced tongue root|±ATR]]), [[Somali language|Somali]] (breathy and harsh voice).&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmondson&quot;/&gt;

Elements of laryngeal articulation or phonation may occur widely in the world's languages as phonetic detail even when not phonemically contrastive. For example, simultaneous glottal, ventricular, and arytenoid activity (for something other than [[epiglottal consonant]]s) has been observed in [[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Nootka language|Nuuchahnulth]], [[Thompson language|Nlaka'pamux]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Sui language|Sui]], [[Amis language|Amis]], [[Pame language|Pame]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], and [[Yi language|Yi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmondson&quot;/&gt;

==Familiar language examples==
In languages such as [[French language|French]], all [[obstruent]]s occur in pairs, one modally voiced and one voiceless.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In [[English language|English]], every voiced [[fricative]] corresponds to a voiceless one. For the pairs of English [[stop consonant|stops]], however, the distinction is better specified as [[voice onset time]] rather than simply voice: In initial position /b d g/ are only partially voiced (voicing begins during the hold of the consonant), while /p t k/ are [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] (voicing doesn't begin until well after its release).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Certain English [[morpheme]]s have voiced and voiceless [[allomorph]]s, such as the plural, verbal, and possessive endings spelled ''-s'' (voiced in ''kids'' {{IPA|/kɪdz/}} but voiceless in ''kits'' {{IPA|/kɪts/}}) and the past-tense ending spelled ''-ed'' (voiced in ''buzzed'' {{IPA|/bʌzd/}} but voiceless in ''fished'' {{IPA|/fɪʃt/}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

A few European languages, such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]], have no phonemically voiced [[obstruent]]s but pairs of long and short consonants instead. Outside of Europe, a lack of voicing distinctions is not uncommon; indeed, in [[Australian languages]] it is nearly universal. In languages without the distinction between voiceless and voiced obstruents, it is often found that they are realized as voiced in voiced environments such as between vowels, and voiceless elsewhere.

==Vocal registers==
:''See also [[Speech register]], a subset of a language used in a particular social setting.''

===In phonology===
{{main|Register (phonology)}}
In [[phonology]], a '''register''' is a combination of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel phonation into a single phonological parameter. For example, among its vowels, [[Burmese language|Burmese]] combines modal voice with low tone, breathy voice with falling tone, creaky voice with high tone, and [[glottal stop|glottal closure]] with high tone. These four registers contrast with each other, but no other combination of phonation (modal, breath, creak, closed) and tone (high, low, falling) is found.

===In pedagogy and speech pathology===
{{main|Vocal registration}}
Among vocal pedagogues and speech pathologists, a '''vocal register''' also refers to a particular phonation limited to a particular range of [[Pitch (psychophysics)|pitch]], which possesses a characteristic sound quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Large&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
| last = Large

| month = February/March
| title = Towards an Integrated Physiologic-Acoustic Theory of Vocal Registers

| volume = 28
| pages = 30–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;register&quot; may be used for several distinct aspects of the human voice:&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinney&quot;/&gt;

*A particular part of the [[vocal range]], such as the upper, middle, or lower registers, which may be bounded by vocal breaks
*A particular phonation
*A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]]
*A certain vocal [[timbre]]

Four combinations of these elements are identified in speech pathology: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], a '''principal ideal domain''', or '''PID''', is an [[integral domain]] in which every [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] is [[principal ideal|principal]], i.e., can be generated by a single element. More generally, a [[principal ideal ring]] is a nonzero commutative ring whose ideals are principal, although some authors (e.g., Bourbaki) refer to PIDs as principal rings. The distinction is that a principal ideal ring may have [[zero divisor]]s whereas a principal ideal domain cannot. 

Principal ideal domains are thus mathematical objects which behave somewhat like the [[integers]], with respect to [[Integral domain#Divisibility, prime and irreducible elements|divisibility]]: any element of a PID has a unique decomposition into [[Integral domain#Divisibility, prime and irreducible elements|prime elements]] (so an analogue of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] holds); any two elements of a PID have a [[greatest common divisor]] (although it may not be possible to find it using the [[Euclidean algorithm]]). If ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of a PID without common divisors, then every element of the PID can be written in the form ''ax''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''by''.

Principal ideal domains are [[noetherian ring|noetherian]], they are  [[integrality|integrally closed]], they are [[unique factorization domain]]s and [[Dedekind domain|Dedekind rings]].  All [[Euclidean domain]]s and all [[field (mathematics)|fields]] are principal ideal domains.

: '''[[Commutative ring]]s''' ⊃  '''[[integral domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[integrally closed domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[unique factorization domain]]s''' ⊃ '''principal ideal domains''' ⊃ '''[[Euclidean domain]]s''' ⊃ '''[[field (mathematics)|field]]s'''

==Examples==
Examples include:
* ''K'': any [[field (mathematics)|field]],
* '''Z''': the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[integer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See Fraleigh &amp; Katz (1967), p. 73, Corollary of Theorem 1.7, and notes at p. 369, after the corollary of Theorem 7.2&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''K''[''x'']: [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]] in one variable with coefficients in a field. (The converse is also true; that is, if ''A''[''x''] is a PID, then ''A'' is a field.) Furthermore, a ring of formal power series in one variable over a field is a PID since every ideal is of the form &lt;math&gt;(x^k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;!-- Probably true for any noetherian local ring with a principal maximal ideal.--&gt;
* '''Z'''[''i'']: the ring of [[Gaussian integers]]&lt;ref&gt;See Fraleigh &amp; Katz (1967), p. 385, Theorem 7.8 and p. 377, Theorem 7.4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Z'''[ω] (where ω is a primitive cube root of 1): the [[Eisenstein integers]]

Examples of integral domains that are not PIDs:
* '''Z'''[''x'']: the ring of all polynomials with integer coefficients --- it is not principal because the ideal generated by 2 and ''X'' is an example of an ideal that cannot be generated by a single polynomial.
* ''K''[''x'',''y'']: The ideal (''x'',''y'') is not principal.

==Modules==
{{main|Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain}}
The key result is the structure theorem:  If ''R'' is a principal ideal domain, and ''M'' is a finitely
generated ''R''-module, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a direct sum of cyclic modules, i.e., modules with one generator.  The cyclic modules are isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;R/xR&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;x\in R&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;See also Ribenboim (2001), [http://books.google.com/books?id=u5443xdaNZcC&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113], proof of lemma 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

If ''M'' is a free module over a principal ideal domain ''R'', then every submodule of ''M'' is again free. This does not hold for modules over arbitrary rings, as the example &lt;math&gt;(2,X)  \subseteq \Bbb{Z}[X]&lt;/math&gt;   of  modules over &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}[X]&lt;/math&gt; shows.

==Properties==
In a principal ideal domain, any two elements ''a'',''b'' have a [[greatest common divisor]], which may be obtained as a generator of the ideal ''(a,b)''.

All [[Euclidean domain]]s are principal ideal domains, but the converse is not true.
An example of a principal ideal domain that is not a Euclidean domain is the ring &lt;math&gt;\Bbb{Z}\left[(1+\sqrt{-19})/2\right].&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Jack C. &quot;A Principal Ring that is Not a Euclidean Ring.&quot; [[Math. Mag]] '''46''' (Jan 1973) 34-38 [http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0025-570X(197301)46%3A1%3C34%3AAPIRTI%3E2.0.CO%3B2-U]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Bergman, ''A principal ideal domain that is not Euclidean - developed as a series of exercises'' [http://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/grad.hndts/nonEucPID.ps PostScript file]&lt;/ref&gt; In this domain no q and r exist, with 0≤|r|&lt;4, so that &lt;math&gt;(1+\sqrt{-19})=(4)q+r&lt;/math&gt;, despite &lt;math&gt;1+\sqrt{-19}&lt;/math&gt; and 4 having a greatest common divisor of 2.

Every principal ideal domain is a [[unique factorization domain]] (UFD).&lt;ref&gt;Proof: every prime ideal is generated by one element, which is necessarily prime. Now refer to the fact that an integral domain is a UFD if and only if its prime ideals contain prime elements.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson (2009), p. 148, Theorem 2.23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraleigh &amp; Katz (1967), p. 368, Theorem 7.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hazewinkel, Gubareni &amp; Kirichenko (2004), [http://books.google.com/books?id=AibpdVNkFDYC&amp;pg=PA166 p.166], Theorem 7.2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The converse does not hold since for any UFD ''K'', ''K''[''X'',''Y''] is a UFD but is not a PID (to prove this look at the ideal generated by &lt;math&gt;\left\langle X,Y \right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; It is not the whole ring since it contains no polynomials of degree 0, but it cannot be generated by any one single element).

#Every principal ideal domain is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]].
#In all unital rings, [[maximal ideal]]s are [[prime ideal|prime]]. In principal ideal domains a near converse holds: every nonzero prime ideal is maximal.
#All principal ideal domains are [[integrally closed]].

The previous three statements give the definition of a [[Dedekind domain]], and hence every principal ideal domain is a Dedekind domain.

Let ''A'' be an integral domain. Then the following are equivalent.

# ''A'' is a PID.
# Every prime ideal of ''A'' is principal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.berkeley.edu/~mreyes/oka1.pdf T. Y. Lam and Manuel L. Reyes, A Prime Ideal Principle in Commutative Algebra]&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A'' is a Dedekind domain that is a UFD.
# Every finitely generated ideal of ''A'' is principal (i.e., ''A'' is a [[Bézout domain]]) and ''A'' satisfies the [[ascending chain condition on principal ideals]].
# ''A'' admits a [[Dedekind–Hasse norm]].&lt;ref&gt;Hazewinkel, Gubareni &amp; Kirichenko (2004), [http://books.google.com/books?id=AibpdVNkFDYC&amp;pg=PA170 p.170], Proposition 7.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[field norm]] is a Dedekind-Hasse norm; thus, (5) shows that a Euclidean domain is a PID. (4) compares to:
* An integral domain is a UFD if and only if it is a [[GCD domain]] (i.e., a domain where every two elements has a greatest common divisor) satisfying the ascending chain condition on principal ideals.
An integral domain is a [[Bézout domain]] if and only if any two elements in it have a gcd ''that is a linear combination of the two.'' A Bézout domain is thus a GCD domain, and (4) gives yet another proof that a PID is a UFD.

Pioneer 10 and [[Pioneer 11|11]] are the most famous probes in the Pioneer program, the first probes to visit the [[Solar system#Outer planets|outer planets]], and the first to go beyond the orbit of [[Pluto]].]]
[[File:Pioneer10-plaque.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pioneer plaque]] attached to Pioneers 10 and 11]]
The '''Pioneer program''' is a series of [[United States]] [[unmanned space missions]] that was designed for planetary exploration. There were a number of such missions in the program, but the most notable were [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]], which explored the outer planets and left the [[solar system]]. Each carries a golden [[Pioneer plaque|plaque]], depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, should any [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] find them someday.

Credit for naming the first probe has been attributed to Stephen A. Saliga, who had been assigned to the Air Force Orientation Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, as chief designer of Air Force exhibits. While he was at a briefing, the spacecraft was described to him as a &quot;lunar-orbiting vehicle with an infrared scanning device.&quot; Saliga thought the title too long and lacked theme for an exhibit design. He suggested &quot;Pioneer&quot; as the name of the probe since &quot;the Army had already launched and orbited the Explorer satellite and their Public Information Office was identifying the Army as 'Pioneers in Space,'&quot; and by adopting the name the Air Force would &quot;make a 'quantum jump' as to who really [were] the 'Pioneers in space.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

== Early Pioneer missions ==
The earliest missions were attempts to achieve Earth's [[escape velocity]], simply to show it was feasible and study the [[Moon]]. This included the first launch by [[NASA]] which was formed from the old [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]]. These missions were carried out by the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] and [[United States Army|Army]].

Five years after the early Able space probe missions ended, [[NASA Ames Research Center]] used the Pioneer name for a new series of missions, initially aimed at the inner solar system, before the bold flyby missions to [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]]. While successful, the missions returned much poorer images than the [[Voyager program|Voyager's]] five years later. In 1978, the end of the program saw a return to the inner solar system, with the [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] and [[Pioneer Venus Multiprobe|Multiprobe]], this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

The new missions were numbered from Pioneer 6 (alternate names in parentheses).

=== Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9 – interplanetary space &quot;weather network&quot; ===
[[File:Pioneer-6-9.jpg|thumb|Artist's conception of the Pioneer 6–9 spacecraft]]
The spacecraft in Pioneer missions [[Pioneer 6, 7, 8, and 9|6, 7, 8, and 9]]:
* Pioneer 6 (Pioneer A) – launched December 1965
* Pioneer 7 (Pioneer B) – launched August 1966
* Pioneer 8 (Pioneer C) – launched December 1967
* Pioneer 9 (Pioneer D) – launched November 1968 (''defunct since 1983'')
* Pioneer E – lost in launcher failure August 1969
Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 0.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]s distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth's.&lt;br /&gt;
Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 1.1 AUs distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth's.&lt;br /&gt;
Because they orbit the Sun on either side of the Earth's orbital path, some of them are, from time to time, 180° away from Earth. They can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun's rotation reveals it to ground based/earth orbiting observatories. If a powerful solar magnetic storm is born, they can warn Earth in advance.

The '''Lockheed P-38 Lightning''' was a [[World War II]] American [[fighter aircraft]] built by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]. Developed to a [[United States Army Air Corps]] requirement, the P-38 had distinctive [[twin boom]]s and a single, central [[nacelle]] containing the cockpit and armament. Named &quot;fork-tailed devil&quot; (''der Gabelschwanz-Teufel'') by the [[Luftwaffe]] and {{nihongo|&quot;two planes, one pilot&quot;|2飛行機、1パイロット|Ni hikōki, ippairotto}} by the Japanese,&lt;ref&gt;Boyne 1993, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; the P-38 was used in a number of roles, including [[Dive bomber|dive bombing]], [[Level bomber|level bombing]], [[Ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]], [[Night fighter|night fighting]], [[Aerial reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] missions,&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF Museum&quot;&gt;[http://www.af.mil/information/transcripts/story.asp?storyID=123006545 &quot;P-38 Lightning.&quot;] ''National Museum of the United States Air Force.'' Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and extensively as a long-[[Range (aircraft)|range]] [[escort fighter]] when equipped with [[drop tank]]s under its wings.

The P-38 was used most successfully in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]] and the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|China-Burma-India Theater of Operations]] as the mount of America's top [[flying ace|ace]]s, [[Richard Bong]] (40 victories) and [[Thomas McGuire]] (38 victories). In the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|South West Pacific theater]], the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of [[United States Army Air Forces]] until the appearance of large numbers of [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51D Mustang]]s toward the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanaway&quot;&gt;Stanaway 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AcePilots.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.acepilots.com/usaaf_pto_aces.html &quot;PTO/CBI Pilots of WWII, Top American aces of the Pacific &amp; CBI.&quot;] ''acepilots.com.'' Retrieved: 8 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The P-38 was unusually quiet for a fighter, the exhaust muffled by the [[Turbosupercharging|turbo-supercharger]]s. It was extremely forgiving, and could be mishandled in many ways, but the rate of roll in the early versions was too slow for it to excel as a dogfighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunston p. 133.&quot;&gt;Gunston 1980, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;
The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in production throughout American involvement in the war, from [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] to [[Victory over Japan Day]].
{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Design and development==
[[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] designed the P-38 in response to a February 1937 specification from the [[United States Army Air Corps]]. Circular Proposal X-608 was a set of aircraft performance goals authored by [[First Lieutenant]] [[Benjamin S. Kelsey]] (later [[Brigadier General]]) and First Lieutenant [[Gordon P. Saville]] (later [[General]]) for a twin-engine, high-altitude &quot;interceptor&quot; having &quot;the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsey recalled in 1977 that he and Saville drew up the specification using the word ''interceptor'' as a way to bypass the inflexible Army Air Corps requirement for pursuit aircraft to carry no more than 500&amp;nbsp;lb (227&amp;nbsp;kg) of armament including ammunition, as well as the restriction of single-seat aircraft to one engine. Kelsey was looking for a minimum of 1,000&amp;nbsp;lb (454&amp;nbsp;kg) of armament.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsey and Saville aimed to get a more capable fighter; better at dog-fighting and at high-altitude combat. Specifications called for a maximum airspeed of at least 360&amp;nbsp;mph (580&amp;nbsp;km/h) at altitude, and a climb to 20,000&amp;nbsp;ft (6,100&amp;nbsp;m) within six minutes;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dave's&quot;&gt;Hanson, Dave. [http://www.daveswarbirds.com/usplanes/aircraft/histp-38.htm &quot;Lockheed P-38 Lightning.&quot;] ''Dave's Warbirds.'' Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the toughest set of specifications USAAC had presented to that date. The unbuilt [[Vultee Aircraft|Vultee]] XP1015 was designed to the same requirement, but was not advanced enough to merit further investigation. A similar single-engine proposal was issued at the same time: Circular Proposal X-609, in response to which the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] was designed.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Both proposals required liquid-cooled [[Allison V-1710]] engines with turbo-superchargers and both gave extra points for [[tricycle undercarriage|tricycle landing gear]].

The Lockheed design team, under the direction of [[Hall Hibbard]] and [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson]], considered a range of twin-engine configurations including both engines in a central fuselage with push-pull propellers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p38assn.org/xpdrawings.htm &quot;XP-38 Design Drawings: A diagram of the configurations considered for the prototype.&quot;] ''P-38 National Association &amp; Museum''. Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The eventual configuration was rare in terms of contemporary fighter aircraft design, with only the preceding [[Fokker G.1]], contemporary [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189]] Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft, and the later  [[USAAF]]'s [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]] night fighter having a similar [[planform]]. The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbo-superchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mock-up was designed to mount two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s, with 200&amp;nbsp;rpg, two .30&amp;nbsp;in (7.62&amp;nbsp;mm) Brownings, with 500&amp;nbsp;rpg, and a T1 Army Ordnance .90&amp;nbsp;in (23&amp;nbsp;mm) [[autocannon]] with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the non-existent 25&amp;nbsp;mm [[Hotchkiss et Cie|Hotchkiss]] aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the YP-38s, a larger [[John Browning]]-designed, [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]]-made [[M4 cannon|M9 37&amp;nbsp;mm (1.46&amp;nbsp;in) autocannon]] with 15 rounds replaced the T1.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The 15 rounds were in three 5-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the M9 did not perform reliably in flight. Further armament experiments from March to June 1941 resulted in the P-38E combat configuration of four M2 Browning machine guns, and one [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano]] 20&amp;nbsp;mm (.79&amp;nbsp;in) [[autocannon]] with 150 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An armorer's assistant in a large western aircraft plant works on the installation of one of the machine guns in the... - NARA - 196367.jpg|thumb|left|P-38 armament, concentrated in the nose of the aircraft]]
Clustering all the armament in the nose was unlike most other U.S. aircraft which used wing-mounted guns with trajectories set up to crisscross at one or more points in a &quot;convergence zone.&quot; Guns mounted in the nose did not suffer from having their useful ranges limited by pattern convergence, meaning good pilots could shoot much farther. A Lightning could reliably hit targets at any range up to {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, whereas other fighters had to pick a single convergence range between 100 and {{convert|250|yd|m|abbr=on}}. The clustered weapons had a &quot;buzz saw&quot; effect on any target at the receiving end, making the aircraft effective for strafing as well. The [[rate of fire]] on the guns was about 650 rounds per minute for the 20×110&amp;nbsp;mm cannon round (130&amp;nbsp;gram shell) at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2887|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, and for the .50&amp;nbsp;inch machine guns (43–48&amp;nbsp;gram rounds), about 850 rpm at {{convert|2756|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} velocity. Combined rate of fire was over 4,000 rpm with roughly every sixth projectile a 20&amp;nbsp;mm. The duration of sustained firing for the 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and .50 caliber machine guns was approximately 14 seconds and 35 seconds respectively.

The Lockheed design incorporated tricycle undercarriage and a bubble canopy, and featured two 1,000&amp;nbsp;[[Horsepower|hp]] (746&amp;nbsp;[[kilowatt|kW]]) [[turbocharger|turbo]]-[[supercharger|supercharged]] 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines fitted with [[counter-rotating propellers]] to eliminate the effect of engine [[torque]], with the superchargers positioned behind the engines, with the exhaust side of the units exposed along the dorsal surfaces of the booms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation Museum&quot;/&gt; Counter-rotation was achieved with the use of &quot;handed&quot; engines, which meant that the crankshaft of each engine turned in the opposite direction of its counterpart. The V-12 engines only required that the spark plug firing order be changed in order for the direction of the crank shaft to be reversed, according to the General Motors [[Allison V-1710#Technical description|Allison V-1710]] Service School Handbook.&lt;ref name=&quot;America's Hundred Thousand&quot;&gt;Dean, Francis H.

[[File:020903-o-9999b-059.jpg|thumb|One of 13 YP-38s constructed]]

Kelsey then proposed a speed dash to [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Field]] on 11 February 1939 to relocate the aircraft for further testing. [[Henry Arnold|General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold]], commander of the USAAC, approved of the record attempt, and recommended a cross-country flight to New York. The flight set a speed record by flying from California to New York in seven hours and two minutes, not counting two refueling stops,&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation Museum&quot;&gt;[http://www.aviation-history.com/lockheed/p38.html &quot;Lockheed P-38 Lightning.&quot;] ''aviation-history.com.'' Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but the aircraft was downed by carburetor icing short of the [[Mitchel Field]] runway in [[Hempstead (town), New York|Hempstead, New York]], and was wrecked. However, on the basis of the record flight, the Air Corps ordered 13 '''YP-38'''s on 27 April 1939 for US$134,284 apiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald&quot;&gt;Donald 1997, p. 581.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;knaack&quot;&gt;Knaack 1978, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; (The initial &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;YP&quot; was the USAAC's designation for a [[prototype]] while the &quot;X&quot; in &quot;XP&quot; was for [[Experimental aircraft|experimental]].) Lockheed's Chief [[test pilot]] [[Tony LeVier]] angrily characterized the accident as an unnecessary publicity stunt,&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; but according to Kelsey the loss of the prototype, instead of hampering the program, speeded the process by cutting short the initial test series.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the aircraft design contributed to Kelsey's promotion to captain in May 1939.

[[File:Mechanized P-38 conveyor lines.jpg|thumb|Mechanized P-38 conveyor lines]]

Manufacture of the YP-38s fell behind schedule, at least partly due to the need for mass-production suitability making them substantially different in construction than the prototype. Another factor was the sudden required facility expansion of Lockheed in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], taking it from a specialized civilian firm dealing with small orders to a large government defense contractor making [[Lockheed Ventura|Venturas]], [[Lockheed_Ventura#PV-2_Harpoon|Harpoons]], [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|Lodestar]]s, [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]]s, and designing the [[Lockheed Constellation|Constellation]] airliner for [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]. The first YP-38 was not completed until September 1940, with its maiden flight on 17 September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://p38assn.org/aboutp38.htm &quot;About the P-38: Early Years.&quot;] ''P-38 National Association &amp; Museum.'' Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th and final YP-38 was delivered to the Air Corps in June 1941; 12 aircraft were retained for flight testing and one for destructive stress testing. The YPs were substantially redesigned and differed greatly in detail from the hand-built XP-38. They were lighter, included changes in engine fit, and the propeller rotation was reversed, with the blades rotating outwards (away) from the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] at the top of their arc rather than inwards as before. This improved the aircraft's stability as a gunnery platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;&gt;[http://collections.nasm.si.edu/code/emuseum.asp?style=single&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=search&amp;profile=objects&amp;searchdesc=A19600295000&amp;quicksearch=A19600295000&amp;newvalues=1&amp;newstyle=expanded&amp;newcurrentrecord=1 &quot;Collections Database: Lockheed P-38J-10-LO Lightning.&quot;] ''National Air and Space Museum''.

===High-speed compressibility problems===
Test flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail [[Wing flutter|flutter]]. During high-speed flight approaching Mach&amp;nbsp;0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed [[Compressibility#Aeronautical dynamics|compressibility stall]] and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using [[Trim tab|elevator trim]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Aviation Museum&quot;/&gt; Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation, but first they had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the Free French Air Force operating from England.

By November 1941, many of the initial assembly line challenges had been met and there was some breathing room for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge; tabs that were designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over {{convert|30|lb-f|N}}, as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old&lt;ref&gt;[http://eugenedownes.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/greatpilot.jpg &quot;Ralph Virden obituary.&quot;] ''eugenedownes.tripod.com.'' Retrieved: 10 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow, and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft, underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about {{convert|3500|ft|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were ''not'' the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter, and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.

In 1941 flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's [[empennage]] was completely skinned in aluminum{{#tag:ref|&quot;Sheet Metal Repair to the P-38 Lightning&quot;, original Lockheed training film, from TM Technologies showes skinning and repair.|group=N}} rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodie p. 58&quot;&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, though the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped and dangerously steep test flights flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote &quot;the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher YP-38&quot;&gt;Baugher, Joe.

[[File:Compressibility010.png|thumb|P-38 pilot training manual compressibility chart shows speed limit vs. altitude.]]

After months of pushing [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] to provide Mach&amp;nbsp;0.75 wind tunnel speeds (and finally succeeding), the compressibility problem was revealed to be the center of lift moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The compressibility problem was solved by changing the geometry of the wing's underside when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles and in action they extended downward 35° in 1½ seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the center of pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, pp. 174–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field modification kits were assembled to give North African, European and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. Unfortunately, these crucial flaps did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for [[European Theater of Operations]] (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken [[identification friend or foe|identification]] incident in which a RAF fighter shot down the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] (mistaking it for an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]]) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the tarmac and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps were effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation with only the final 50% of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Ethell et al. 1984, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson later recalled:
{{quote|I broke an ulcer over compressibility on the P-38 because we flew into a speed range where no one had ever been before, and we had difficulty convincing people that it wasn't the funny-looking airplane itself, but a fundamental physical problem. We found out what happened when the Lightning shed its tail and we worked during the whole war to get 15 more kn [28 km/h] of speed out of the P-38. We saw compressibility as a brick wall for a long time. Then we learned how to get through it.&lt;ref&gt;Goebel, Greg. [http://www.vectorsite.net/avp38.html &quot;The Lockheed P-38 Lightning.&quot;] ''vectorsite.net'', Version 1.3. Retrieved: 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Buffeting]] was another early aerodynamic problem, difficult to sort out from compressibility as both were reported by test pilots as &quot;tail shake&quot;. Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading edge wing slots were tried as were combinations of filleting between the wing, cockpit and engine nacelles. Air tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of {{convert|500|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting forever solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodie p. 58&quot;/&gt;

Another issue with the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of outwardly rotating (at the &quot;tops&quot; of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin engine non-[[centerline thrust]] aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip down on the side of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engine aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff would be to push the remaining engine to full throttle; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and [[p-factor]] force produced a sudden uncontrollable yawing roll and the aircraft would flip over and slam into the ground. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the dead engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engine takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; This same design feature was present from its earliest days on the Luftwaffe twin-engine [[Henschel Hs 129]] ground-attack aircraft. 

The engines were unusually quiet because the [[Exhaust system|exhaust]]s were [[muffler|muffled]] by the [[General Electric]] turbo-superchargers on the twin [[Allison V-1710 engine|Allison V12s]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Saunders 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too hot in the tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting, and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as the distance of the engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.

On 20 September 1939, before the YP-38s had been built and flight tested, the USAAF ordered 66 initial production P-38 Lightnings, 30 of which were delivered to the USAAF in mid-1941, but not all these aircraft were armed. The unarmed aircraft were subsequently fitted with four .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns (instead of the two .50&amp;nbsp;in/12.7&amp;nbsp;mm and two .30&amp;nbsp;in/7.62&amp;nbsp;mm of their predecessors) and a 37&amp;nbsp;mm (1.46&amp;nbsp;in) cannon.

The USAAF specified that these 36 aircraft were to be designated '''P-38D'''. As a result, there never were any P-38Bs or P-38Cs. The P-38D's main role was to work out bugs and give the USAAF experience with handling the type.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher P-38D&quot;&gt;Baugher, Joe.

In March 1940, the [[France|French]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]], through the [[Anglo-French Purchasing Committee]], ordered a total of 667 P-38s for US$100M,&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; designated '''Model 322F''' for the French and '''Model 322B''' for the British.

===Entry to the war===
The first Lightning to see active service was the F-4 version, a P-38E in which the guns were replaced by four K17 cameras.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maloney&quot;&gt;Maloney 1968, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; They joined the 8th Photographic Squadron out of [[Australia]] on 4 April 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; Three F-4s were operated by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in this theater for a short period beginning in September 1942.

On 29 May 1942, 25 P-38s began operating in the [[Aleutian Islands]] in [[Alaska]]. The fighter's long range made it well-suited to the campaign over the almost 1,200&amp;nbsp;mi (2,000&amp;nbsp;km)–long island chain, and it would be flown there for the rest of the war. The Aleutians were one of the most rugged environments available for testing the new aircraft under combat conditions. More Lightnings were lost due to severe weather and other conditions than enemy action, and there were cases where Lightning pilots, mesmerized by flying for hours over gray seas under gray skies, simply flew into the water. On 9 August 1942, two P-38Es of the 343rd Fighter Group, [[Eleventh Air Force|11th Air Force]], at the end of a 1,000&amp;nbsp;mi (1,609&amp;nbsp;km) long-range patrol, happened upon a pair of Japanese [[Kawanishi H6K]] &quot;Mavis&quot; flying boats and destroyed them,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smithsonian&quot;/&gt; making them the first Japanese aircraft to be shot down by Lightnings.

===European theater===

After the [[Battle of Midway]], the USAAF began redeploying fighter groups to Britain as part of [[Operation Bolero]], and Lightnings of the 1st Fighter Group were flown across the Atlantic via [[Iceland]]. On 14 August 1942, [[Second Lieutenant]] Elza Shahan of the 27th Fighter Squadron, and Second Lieutenant Joseph Shaffer of the 33rd Squadron operating out of Iceland shot down a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] ''Condor'' over the Atlantic. Shahan in his P-38F downed the ''Condor''; Shaffer, flying either a P-40C or a P-39, had already set an engine on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Stanaway 2001, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed by the USAAF.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanaway Europe&quot;&gt;Stanaway, John C.

After 347 sorties with no enemy contact, the 1st, 14th and 82nd Fighter Groups were transferred to the 12th Air Force in North Africa as part of the force being built up for [[Operation Torch]]. On 19 November 1942, Lightnings escorted a group of [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers on a raid over Tunis. On 5 April 1943, 26 P-38Fs of the 82nd claimed 31 enemy aircraft destroyed, helping to establish air superiority in the area, and earning it the German nickname &quot;''der Gabelschwanz Teufel''&quot;&amp;nbsp;– the Fork-Tailed Devil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher European&quot;/&gt; The P-38 remained active in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war.
It was in this theatre that the P-38 suffered its heaviest losses in the air. On 25 August 1943, 13 P-38s were shot down in a single sortie by [[Jagdgeschwader 53|''Jagdgeschwader'' 53]] [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109]]s without achieving a single kill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scutts p.61&quot;&gt;Scutts 1994, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 September 10 P-38s were shot down, in return for a single kill, the 67-victory ace [[Franz Schiess]] (who was also the leading &quot;Lightning&quot; killer in the Luftwaffe with 17 destroyed).&lt;ref name=&quot;Scutts p.61&quot;/&gt;
[[Kurt Bühligen]], third highest scoring German pilot on Western front with 112 victories, recalled later: “The P-38 fighter (and the B-24) were easy to burn. Once in Africa we were six and met eight P-38s and shot down seven. One sees a great distance in Africa and our observers and flak people called in sightings and we could get altitude first and they were low and slow.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Sims pp. 134-135.&quot;&gt;Sims 1980, pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; ''General der Jagdflieger'' [[Adolf Galland]] was unimpressed with the P-38, declaring, &quot;it had similar shortcomings in combat to our [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]], our fighters were clearly superior to it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;first and last&quot;&gt;Galland 1954, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiences over Germany had shown a need for long-range escort fighters to protect the [[Eighth Air Force]]'s heavy bomber operations. The P-38Hs of the 55th Fighter Group were transferred to the Eighth in England in September 1943, and were joined by the 20th, 364th and 479th Fighter Groups soon after. P-38s soon joined Spitfires in escorting the early Fortress raids over Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spick p. 94.&quot;&gt;Spick 1983, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

A little-known role of the P-38 in the European theater was that of fighter-bomber during the invasion of Normandy and the Allied advance across France into Germany. Assigned to the IX Tactical Air Command, the [[370th Air Expeditionary Advisory Group|370th Fighter Group]] and its P-38s initially flew missions from England, dive-bombing radar installations, enemy armor, troop concentrations, and [[flak tower]]s.&lt;ref name=370th&gt;[http://www.armyaircorps.us/370th_Fighter_Group.cfm &quot;Army Air Corps, World War II: 370th Fighter Group&quot;.] ''Living History Group''.

Italian pilots in the Mediterranean theatre started to face P-38s from late 1942 and considered it a formidable foe compared to other fighters, including the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. A small number of P-38s fell into the hands of German and Italian units and were subsequently tested and used in combat.

On 12 June 1943, a P-38G, while flying a special mission between [[Gibraltar]] and [[Malta]], landed on the airfield of Capoterra ([[Cagliari]]), in [[Sardinia]], from navigation error due to  a compass failure. ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' chief test pilot ''colonnello'' [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Angelo Tondi flew the aircraft to [[Guidonia Montecelio|Guidonia]] airfield where the P-38G was evaluated. On 11 August 1943, Tondi took off to intercept a formation of about 50 B-24s, returning from the bombing of [[Terni]] ([[Umbria]]). Tondi attacked a bomber that fell off the shore of [[Torvaianica]], near  [[Rome]], while six airmen were parachuting. That was the first and last war mission for the plane, as the Italian petrol was too corrosive for the Lockheed tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimensione cielo p. 72.&quot;&gt;''Dimensione cielo'' 1973, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Lightnings were eventually acquired by Italy for postwar service.

If faced by more agile fighters at low altitudes in a constricted valley, Lightnings could suffer heavy losses. On the morning of 10 June 1944, 96 P-38Js of the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups took off from Italy for [[Ploiești]], the third-most heavily defended target in Europe, after Berlin and Vienna.&lt;ref name=Cesarani/&gt; Instead of bombing from high altitude as had been tried by the [[Fifteenth Air Force#Oil Industry Targets|Fifteenth Air Force]], USAAF planning had determined that a dive-bombing surprise attack, beginning at about {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2}} with bomb release at or below {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2}},&lt;ref name=Cesarani&gt;Cesarani and Kavanaugh 2004, pp. 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt; performed by 46 [[82d Operations Group|82nd Fighter Group]] P-38s, each carrying one {{convert|1000|lb|kg|-2|adj=on}} bomb, would yield more accurate results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanaway ETO/MTO&quot;&gt;Stanaway 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–46.&lt;/ref&gt; All of [[1st Operations Group#Italian operations|1st Fighter Group]] and a few aircraft in 82nd Fighter Group were to fly cover, and all fighters were to strafe targets of opportunity on the return trip; a distance of some {{convert|1255|mi|km|-1}}, including a circuitous outward route made in an attempt to achieve surprise.&lt;ref name=Cesarani/&gt;

Some 85–86 fighters arrived in Romania to find enemy airfields alerted, with a wide assortment of aircraft scrambling for safety. P-38s shot down several enemy including heavy fighters, transports and observation aircraft. At Ploiești, defense forces were fully alert, the target was concealed by [[smoke screen]], and [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]] was very heavy—seven Lightnings were lost to it at the target, and two more during strafing attacks on the return flight. German Bf&amp;nbsp;109 fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77 fought the Americans. One flight of 16, the 71st Fighter Squadron, was challenged by a large formation of Romanian single-seater [[IAR 80#IAR.81|IAR.81C]] fighters. The fight took place at and below {{convert|300|ft|m|-2}} in a narrow valley.&lt;ref name=Hatch&gt;Hatch 2000, pp. 59–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert Hatch saw two IAR&amp;nbsp;81Cs that he misidentified as [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s hit the ground after taking fire from his guns, and his fellow pilots confirmed three more of his kills. However, the outnumbered 71st Fighter Squadron took more damage than it dished out, losing nine aircraft. In all, the USAAF lost 22 aircraft on the mission.

After some disastrous raids in 1944 with B-17s escorted by P-38s and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]]s, Jimmy Doolittle, then head of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, went to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE), Farnborough, asking for an evaluation of the various American fighters. [[Fleet Air Arm]] Captain and [[test pilot]] [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalled: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;We had found out that the Bf&amp;nbsp;109 and the Fw&amp;nbsp;190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn't fly in combat faster than 0.68. So it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photo-reconnaissance and had to be withdrawn from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson with Smith p. 240.&quot;&gt;Thompson with Smith 2008, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After evaluation tests at Farnborough, the P-38 was kept in fighting service in Europe for a while longer. However, even if many of the aircraft's problems were fixed with the introduction of the P-38J, by September 1944, all but one of the Lightning groups in the Eighth Air Force had converted to the P-51 Mustang. The Eighth Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance missions using the F-5 variant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher European&quot;/&gt;

===Pacific theater===
[[File:&quot;Give us More P-38's&quot; - NARA - 514398.jpg|thumb|left|Wartime poster encouraging greater production of P-38s]]
The P-38 was used most extensively and successfully in the Pacific theater, where it proved ideally suited, combining excellent performance with very long range, and had the added reliability of two engines for long missions over water. The P-38 was used in a variety of roles, especially escorting bombers at altitudes between 18–25,000&amp;nbsp;ft (5,500-7,600&amp;nbsp;m). The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other USAAF fighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald&quot;/&gt; Freezing cockpits were not a problem at low altitude in the tropics. In fact, since there was no way to open a window while in flight as it caused buffeting by setting up turbulence through the [[tailplane]], it was often too hot; pilots taking low altitude assignments would often fly stripped down to shorts, tennis shoes, and parachute. While the P-38 could not out-turn the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|A6M Zero]] and most other Japanese fighters when flying below {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}}, its superior speed coupled with a good rate of climb meant that it could utilize [[Basic fighter maneuvers#Energy management|energy tactics]], making multiple high-speed passes at its target. Also, its focused firepower was even more deadly to lightly armored Japanese warplanes than to the Germans'. The concentrated, parallel stream of bullets allowed aerial victory at much longer distances than fighters carrying wing guns. It is therefore ironic that [[Richard Bong|Dick Bong]], the United States' highest-scoring World War II air ace (40 victories solely in P-38s), would fly directly at his targets to make sure he hit them (as he himself acknowledged his poor shooting ability), in some cases flying through the debris of his target (and on one occasion colliding with an enemy aircraft which was claimed as a &quot;probable&quot; victory). The twin Allison engines performed admirably in the Pacific.

General [[George C. Kenney]], commander of the USAAF Fifth Air Force operating in [[New Guinea]], could not get enough P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the 39th Fighter Squadron of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney 1997, pp. 171–173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 2008, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schom 2004, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanaway 1997, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFarland 1997, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments of them, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Bruning 2003, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.

On 2–4 March 1943, P-38s flew top cover for [[Fifth Air Force|5th Air Force]] and Australian bombers and attack aircraft during the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], a crushing defeat for the Japanese. Two P-38 aces from the 39th Fighter Squadron were killed on the second day of the battle: Bob Faurot and Hoyt &quot;Curley&quot; Eason (a veteran with five victories who had trained hundreds of pilots, including Dick Bong).

====Isoroku Yamamoto====
{{Main|Death of Isoroku Yamamoto}}

The Lightning figured in one of the most significant operations in the Pacific theater: the interception, on 18 April 1943, of [[Admiral]] [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], the architect of Japan's naval strategy in the Pacific including the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. When American [[Cryptanalysis|codebreaker]]s found out that he was flying to [[Bougainville Island]] to conduct a front-line inspection, 16 P-38G Lightnings were sent on a long-range fighter-intercept mission, flying {{convert|435|mi|km}} from [[Guadalcanal]] at heights from 10–50&amp;nbsp;ft (3–15&amp;nbsp;m) above the ocean to avoid detection. The Lightnings met Yamamoto's two [[Mitsubishi G4M]] &quot;Betty&quot; fast bomber transports and six escorting Zeros just as they arrived. The first Betty crashed in the jungle and the second ditched near the coast. Two Zeros were also claimed by the American fighters with the loss of one P-38. Japanese searchers found Yamamoto's body at the jungle crash site the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanaway Pacific&quot;&gt;Stanaway 1997, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Service record===
[[File:First Lieutenant H. A. Blood examines ammunition.jpg|thumb|Pilot and aircraft armorer inspect ammunition for the central 20 mm cannon]]

The P-38's service record shows mixed results, but usually because of misinformation. P-38s have been described as being harder to fly than single-engined aircraft, but this was because of inadequate training in the first few months of the war. The P-38's engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One reason for this was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher European&quot;/&gt; Up until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters because of the lack of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a [[Split S]] and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.

On the positive side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of [[RAF Nuthampstead#55th Fighter Group|55FG]] led the group of P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine and one good one, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s he was supposed to escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:P-38 over california.jpg|left|thumb|P-38J ''42-68008'' flying over Southern California.]]

In the ETO, P-38s made 130,000 sorties with a loss of 1.3% overall, comparing favorably with ETO P-51s which posted a 1.1% loss, considering that the P-38s were vastly outnumbered and suffered from poorly thought-out tactics. The majority of the P-38 sorties were made in the period prior to Allied air superiority in Europe when pilots fought against a very determined and skilled enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Mark Hubbard, a vocal critic of the aircraft, rated it third best Allied fighter in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lightning's greatest virtues were long range, heavy payload, high speed, fast climb, and concentrated firepower. The P-38 was a formidable fighter, interceptor and attack aircraft.

In the Pacific theater, the P-38 downed over 1,800 Japanese aircraft, with more than 100 pilots becoming aces by downing five or more enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanaway Pacific&quot;/&gt; American fuel supplies contributed to a better engine performance and maintenance record, and range was increased with leaner mixtures. In the second half of 1944, the P-38L pilots out of Dutch New Guinea were flying {{convert|950|mi|km|abbr=on}}, fighting for 15 minutes and returning to base.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 2001, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Such long legs were invaluable until the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47N]] and P-51D entered service.

===Postwar operations===
The end of the war left the USAAF with thousands of P-38s rendered obsolete by the jet age. The last P-38s in service with the United States Air Force were retired in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bvhcenter.org/P-38-Lightning.html &quot;P-38 Lightning.&quot;] ''Bvhcenter.org,'' 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 100 late-model P-38L and F-5 Lightnings were acquired by Italy through an agreement dated April 1946. Delivered, after refurbishing, at the rate of one per month, they finally were all sent to the AMI by 1952. The Lightnings served in 4 ''Stormo'' and other units including 3 ''Stormo'', flying reconnaissance over the Balkans, ground attack, naval cooperation and air superiority missions. Due to unfamiliarity in operating heavy fighters, old engines, and pilot errors, a large number of P-38s were lost in at least 30 accidents, many of them fatal. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the P-38 because of its excellent visibility on the ground and stability at takeoff. The Italian P-38s were phased out in 1956; none survived the inevitable scrapyard.&lt;ref&gt;Sgarlato 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Surplus P-38s were also used by other foreign air forces with 12 sold to [[Honduras]] and 15 retained by China. Six F-5s and two unarmed black two-seater P-38s were operated by the Dominican Air Force based in San Isidro Airbase, Dominican Republic in 1947. The majority of wartime Lightnings present in the continental U.S. at the end of the war were put up for sale for US$1,200 apiece; the rest were scrapped. P-38s in distant theaters of war were bulldozed into piles and abandoned or scrapped; very few avoided that fate.

The CIA &quot;Liberation Air Force&quot; flew one P-38M to support the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat]]. On 27 June 1954, this aircraft dropped [[napalm]] bombs that destroyed the British cargo ship {{SS|Springfjord}}, which was loading Guatemalan cotton&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foia.cia.gov/docs/DOC_0000919986/DOC_0000919986.pdf &quot;Memorandum for: Chief WH, CIA Subject: Bombing of British ship SS Springfjord.&quot;] ''Central Intelligence Agency,'' 1 July 1955.

P-38s were popular contenders in the air races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making screaming turns around the pylons at [[Reno Air Races|Reno]] and [[National Air Races|Cleveland]]. Lockheed test pilot [[Tony LeVier]] was among those who bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an [[Air racing|air racer]] and [[Competition aerobatics|stunt flyer]]. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the [[Confederate Air Force]], bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it ''White Lightnin{{'}}''; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F style air intakes for better streamlining. ''White Lightnin{{'}}'' was severely damaged in a crash landing during an air show demonstration, and has since been bought, restored, and repainted with a brilliant chrome finish by the company that owns [[Red Bull]]. The aircraft is now located in Austria.

F-5s were bought by [[aerial survey]] companies and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, the use of the Lightning steadily declined, and only a little more than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the [[Lone Star Flight Museum]] in [[Galveston, Texas]], painted in the colors of [[Charles H. MacDonald]]'s ''Putt Putt Maru''. Two other examples are F-5Gs which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in [[Chino, California]] at Yanks Air Museum, and in [[McMinnville, Oregon]] at [[Evergreen Aviation Museum]].

Over 10,000 Lightnings were manufactured in all, becoming the only U.S. combat aircraft that remained in continuous production throughout the duration of American participation in World War II. The Lightning had a major effect on other aircraft; its wing, in a scaled-up form, was used on the [[Lockheed Constellation|L-049 Constellation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;johnson_bio&quot;&gt;[[Clarence Johnson|Johnson, Clarence L. &quot;Kelly&quot;]]. ''Kelly: More Than My Share of it All.'' Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 1985. ISBN 0-87474-491-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===P-38D and P-38Es===
Delivered and accepted Lightning production variants began with the '''P38-D''' model. The few &quot;hand made&quot; YP-38s initially contracted were used as trainers and test aircraft. There were no '''B'''s or '''C'''s delivered to the government as the USAAF allocated the 'D' suffix to all aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;&gt;Caidin, Martin. ''Fork-tailed Devil'', New York: Ballantine Books, 1983. ISBN 0-345-31292-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Many secondary but still initial teething tests were conducted utilizing the earliest D variants.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt;

The first combat-capable Lightning was the '''P-38E''' (and its photo-recon variant the  '''F-4''') which featured improved instruments, electrical, and hydraulic systems. Part-way through production, the older [[Hamilton Standard]] Hydromatic hollow steel propellers were replaced by new [[Curtiss-Wright#Curtiss_Electric_propellers|Curtiss Electric duraluminum propellers]]. The definitive (and now famous) armament configuration was settled upon, featuring four .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns with 500 rpg, and a 20&amp;nbsp;mm (.79&amp;nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza_HS.404#US_production|Hispano]] autocannon with 150 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;Spick 2002, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the machine guns had been arranged symmetrically in the nose on the P-38D, they were &quot;staggered&quot; in the P-38E and later versions, with the muzzles protruding from the nose in the relative lengths of roughly 1:4:6:2. This was done to ensure a straight ammunition-belt feed into the weapons, as the earlier arrangement led to jamming.

The first P-38E rolled out of the factory in October 1941 as the [[Battle of Moscow]] filled the news wires of the world. Because of the versatility, redundant engines, and especially high speed  and high altitude characteristics of the aircraft, as with later variants over a hundred P-38Es were completed in the factory or converted in the field to a photo-reconnaissance variant, the '''F-4''', in which the guns were replaced by four cameras. Most of these early reconnaissance Lightnings were retained stateside for training, but the F-4 was the first Lightning to be used in action in April 1942.

===P-38Fs and P-38Gs===
After 210 P-38Es were built, they were followed, starting in April 1942, by the '''P-38F''', which incorporated racks inboard of the engines for fuel tanks or a total of 2,000&amp;nbsp;lb (907&amp;nbsp;kg) of [[bomb]]s.  Early variants did not enjoy a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38's forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a &quot;combat maneuver&quot; setting was added to the P-38's [[flap (aircraft)|Fowler flap]]s. When deployed at the 8° maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high aileron control forces and a low initial rate of roll,&lt;ref name=Eglin1942&gt;[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/p-38/p-38f-tactical-trials.html &quot;WWII Aircraft Performance: P-38F Tactical Trials&quot;.] ''Final Report on Tactical Suitability of the P-38F Type Airplane'', 6 March 1943. Retrieved: 19 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft,&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific Theater.   

The aircraft was still experiencing extensive teething troubles as well as being victimized by &quot;urban legends&quot;, mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a &quot;widow maker&quot; as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds.  The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Carl Andrew Spaatz|General Spaatz]], then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: &quot;I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't go like hell and has a few things wrong with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lockheed1958/&gt;

[[File:Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning LOC fsa.8d22581.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed P-38G-1-LO Lightning, serial 42-12723]]
The P-38F was followed in early 1943 by the '''P-38G''', utilizing more powerful Allisons of 1,400&amp;nbsp;hp (1,040&amp;nbsp;kW) each and equipped with a better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for what would become the P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines (1,425&amp;nbsp;hp/1,060&amp;nbsp;kW each) in redesigned booms which featured chin-mounted intercoolers in place of the original system in the leading edge of the wings and more efficient radiators.  Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank's twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core intercoolers and radiators.  War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines but retained the old leading edge intercoolers and radiators. 

As the '''P-38H''', 600 of these stop-gap Lightnings with an improved 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon and a bomb capacity of 3,200&amp;nbsp;lb (1,450&amp;nbsp;kg).were produced on one line while the near-definitive P-38J began production on the second line.  The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high altitude and cold weather issues which, while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the [[turbo-supercharger]]s upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTDevil&quot;/&gt; Both the P-38G and P-38H models' performance was restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing's leading edge which had been designed for the YP-38's less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine's charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and would be subject to detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time.  Reliability was not the only issue, either.  For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning's eventual replacement in the Eighth Air Force; fortunately the Fifteenth Air Force were glad to get them.

Some P-38G and H production was diverted on the assembly line to '''F-5A''' and '''F-5B''' [[Surveillance aircraft|reconnaissance aircraft]]. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the '''XF-5D''', with a plexiglas nose, two machine guns and additional cameras in the tail booms.

===Lightning in maturity: P-38J, P-38L===
[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|left|thumb|Four P-38Hs flying in formation]]

The '''P-38J''' was introduced in August 1943. The turbo-supercharger [[intercooler]] system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls were mistakenly activated. In the P-38J model, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a &quot;chin&quot; that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with 55&amp;nbsp;gal (208&amp;nbsp;l) fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically-actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost 600&amp;nbsp;mph (970&amp;nbsp;km/h), although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher P-38J&quot;&gt;Baugher, Joe. [http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/p38_13.html &quot;Lockheed P-38J Lightning.&quot;] ''Joe Baugher's Encyclopedia of American Military Aircraft'', 5 June 1999. Retrieved: 29 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot [[Tony LeVier]]'s four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named &quot;Snafuperman&quot; modified to full P-38J-25-LO specs at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common Eighth Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal.  It proved too little too late because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.&lt;ref&gt;Bodie 1991, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

The P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically-boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning's rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.

There were two '''P-38K'''s developed in 1942–1943, one official and one an internal Lockheed experiment. The first was actually a battered RP-38E &quot;piggyback&quot; test mule previously used by Lockheed to test the P-38J chin intercooler installation, now fitted with paddle-bladed &quot;high activity&quot; [[Hamilton Standard]] Hydromatic propellers similar to those used on the P-47. The new propellers required spinners of greater diameter, and the mule's crude, hand-formed sheet steel cowlings were further stretched to blend the spinners into the nacelles.  It retained its &quot;piggyback&quot; configuration that allowed an observer to ride behind the pilot.  With Lockheed's AAF representative as a passenger and the maneuvering flap deployed to offset Army Hot Day conditions, the old &quot;K-Mule&quot; still climbed to {{convert|45000|ft|m}}.  With a fresh coat of paint covering its crude handformed steel cowlings, this RP-38E acts as stand-in for the &quot;P-38K-1-LO&quot;  in the model's only picture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodie 2001, pp. 169–171&quot;&gt;Bodie 2001, pp. 169–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 12th G model originally set aside as a P-38J prototype was re-designated P-38K-1-LO and fitted with the aforementioned paddle-blade propellers and new Allison V-1710-75/77 (F15R/L) powerplants rated at {{convert|1875|bhp|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power. These engines were geared 2.36 to 1, unlike the standard P-38 ratio of 2 to 1.  The AAF took delivery in September 1943, at [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin Field]]. In tests, the P-38K-1 achieved {{convert|432|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at military power and was predicted to exceed {{convert|450|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at War Emergency Power with a similar increase in load and range. The initial climb rate was {{convert|4800|ft|m|abbr=on}}/min and the ceiling was {{convert|46000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It reached {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in five minutes flat; this with a coat of camouflage paint which added weight and drag. Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two-to-three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised spinners and higher thrust line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodie 2001, pp. 169–171&quot;/&gt; Some have also doubted Allison's ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071021024320/http://www.p-38online.com/p38k.html &quot;P38K.&quot;] ''P-38 Lightning online,'' 21 October 2007. Retrieved: 6 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As promising as it had looked, the P-38K project came to a halt.

The '''P-38L''' was the most numerous variant of the Lightning, with 3,923 built, 113 by [[Consolidated-Vultee]] in their [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] plant. It entered service with the [[USAAF]] in June 1944, in time to support the Allied invasion of France on [[D-Day]]. Lockheed production of the Lightning was distinguished by a suffix consisting of a production block number followed by &quot;LO,&quot; for example &quot;P-38L-1-LO&quot;, while Consolidated-Vultee production was distinguished by a block number followed by &quot;VN,&quot; for example &quot;P-38L-5-VN.&quot;

The P-38L was the first Lightning fitted with zero-length rocket launchers. Seven [[high velocity aircraft rocket]]s (HVARs) on pylons beneath each wing, and later, 10 rockets on each wing on &quot;Christmas tree&quot; launch racks. The P-38L also had strengthened stores pylons to allow carriage of {{convert|2000|lb|kg|-2|abbr=on}} bombs or {{convert|300|gal|l|-2|abbr=on}} drop tanks.

[[File:F-5A Lightning.jpg|thumb|F-5A Lightning of the 7th Photo Group, 8th Army Air Force based at [[RAF Mount Farm|Mount Farm]]. Note the national insignia is bordered in red with overall finish in synthetic haze.]]

Lockheed modified 200 P-38J airframes in production to become unarmed '''F-5B''' photo-reconnaissance aircraft, while hundreds of other P-38Js and P-38Ls were field-modified to become '''F-5E'''s, '''F-5F'''s, and '''F-5G'''s. A few P-38Ls were field-modified to become two-seat '''TP-38L''' familiarization trainers.

Late model Lightnings were delivered unpainted, as per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots worried about being too visible to the enemy, but it turned out the reduction in weight and drag was a minor advantage in combat.

The P-38L-5, the most common sub-variant of the P-38L, had a modified cockpit heating system which consisted of a plug-socket in the cockpit into which the pilot could plug his heat-suit wire for improved comfort. These Lightnings also received the uprated V-1710-111/113 (F30R/L) engines, and this dramatically lowered the amount of engine failure problems experienced at high altitude so commonly associated with European operations.

===Pathfinders, night-fighter and other variants===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
The Lightning was modified for other roles. In addition to the F-4 and F-5 reconnaissance variants, a number of P-38Js and P-38Ls were field-modified as formation bombing &quot;pathfinders&quot; or &quot;droopsnoots&quot;, fitted with a glazed nose with a [[Norden bombsight]], or a [[H2X radar]] &quot;bombing through overcast&quot; nose. A pathfinder would lead a formation of other P-38s, each overloaded with two {{convert|2000|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} bombs; the entire formation releasing when the pathfinder did.

[[File:P-38M Night Fighter.jpg|left|thumb|''44-27234'' a former P-38L converted as a P-38M Night Lightning.]]

A number of Lightnings were modified as night fighters. There were several field or experimental modifications with different equipment fits that finally led to the &quot;formal&quot; '''P-38M''' night fighter, or ''Night Lightning''. A total of 75 P-38Ls were modified to the Night Lightning configuration, painted flat-black with conical [[flash hider]]s on the guns, an AN/APS-6 radar pod below the nose, and a second cockpit with a raised canopy behind the pilot's canopy for the radar operator. The headroom in the rear cockpit was limited, requiring radar operators who were preferably short in stature.

The additional external clutter imposed surprisingly little penalty on the P-38M's performance{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and it remained faster than the purpose-built [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]] [[night fighter]]. The Night Lightnings saw some combat duty in the Pacific towards the end of the war, but none engaged in combat.

One of the initial production P-38s had its turbo-superchargers removed, with a secondary cockpit placed in one of the booms to examine how flightcrew would respond to such an &quot;asymmetric&quot; cockpit layout. One P-38E was fitted with an extended central nacelle to accommodate a tandem-seat cockpit with dual controls, and was later fitted with a laminar flow wing.

[[File:P-38E scorpion-tail.jpg|thumb|P-38E testbed ''41-1986'' shown with second version of upswept tail designed to keep tail out of water upon takeoff for a proposed twin-float variant]]

Very early in the Pacific War, a scheme was proposed to fit Lightnings with floats to allow them to make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. There were concerns that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, and so in March 1942, P-38E ''41-1986'' was modified with a tailplane raised some 16-18&amp;nbsp;in (41–46&amp;nbsp;cm), booms lengthened by two feet and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length but the tail raised {{convert|33|in|cm|abbr=on}}. All three tail modifications were designed by George H. &quot;Bert&quot; Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough [[sealift]] capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bodie p. 32&quot;&gt;Bodie 2001, pp. 118–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still another P-38E was used in 1942 to tow a [[CG-4 Hadrian|Waco troop glider]] as a demonstration. However, there proved to be plenty of other aircraft, such as [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s, available to tow gliders, and the Lightning was spared this duty.

Standard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light, and one fellow who hitched a lift on a P-38 in one of these pods later said that &quot;whoever designed the damn thing should have been forced to ride in it.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Lockheed proposed a carrier-based '''Model 822''' version of the Lightning for the [[United States Navy]]. The Model 822 would have featured folding wings, an arresting hook, and stronger undercarriage for carrier operations. The navy was not interested, as they regarded the Lightning as too big for carrier operations and did not like liquid-cooled engines anyway, and the Model 822 never went beyond the paper stage. However, the navy did operate four land-based F-5Bs in North Africa, inherited from the USAAF and redesignated '''FO-1'''.

A P-38J was used in experiments with an unusual scheme for [[Aerial refueling|mid-air refueling]], in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service either.

After the war, a P-38L was experimentally fitted with armament of three .60&amp;nbsp;in (15.2&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns. The .60&amp;nbsp;in (15.2&amp;nbsp;mm) caliber cartridge had been developed early in the war for an infantry [[anti-tank rifle]], a type of weapon developed by a number of nations in the 1930s when tanks were lighter but, by 1942, the idea of taking on a tank with a large-caliber rifle was no longer considered to be practical.

The cartridge was not abandoned, with the Americans designing a derivative of the German 15&amp;nbsp;mm (.59&amp;nbsp;in) [[MG 151 cannon]] around it and designating the weapon the &quot;T17&quot;, but though 300 of these guns were built and over six million .60&amp;nbsp;in (15.2&amp;nbsp;mm) rounds were manufactured, they never worked out all the bugs, and the T17 never saw operational service. The cartridge was &quot;necked up&quot; to fit 20&amp;nbsp;mm projectiles and became a standard U.S. ammunition after the war. The T17-armed P-38L did not go beyond unsuccessful trials.

Another P-38L was modified after the war as a &quot;super strafer,&quot; with eight .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) machine guns in the nose and a pod under each wing with two .50&amp;nbsp;in (12.7&amp;nbsp;mm) guns, for a total of 12 machine guns. Nothing came of this conversion either.

A P-38L was modified by [[Hindustan Aeronautics]] in India as a fast VIP transport, with a comfortable seat in the nose, leather-lined walls, accommodations for refreshments and a glazed nose to give the passenger a spectacular view.

==Noted P-38s==
[[File:Lockheed P-38 Lightning USAF.JPG|thumb|P-38J Lightning ''YIPPEE'']]

===YIPPEE===
The 5,000th Lightning built, a P-38J-20-LO, ''44-23296'', was painted bright vermilion red, and had the name ''YIPPEE'' painted on the underside of the wings in big white letters as well as the signatures of hundreds of factory workers. This aircraft was used by Lockheed test pilots [[Milo Burcham]] and [[Anthony LeVier|Tony LeVier]] in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at treetop level with one prop feathered to show that the P-38 was not the unmanageable beast of legend. Their exploits did much to reassure pilots that the Lightning might be a handful, but it was by no means a &quot;widow maker.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In-flight footage of the YIPPEE P-38 can be seen in the pilot episode of the ''[[Green Acres]]'' television series.

===Glacier Girl===
On July 15, 1942, a flight of six P-38s and two B-17 bombers, with a total of 25 crew members on board, took off from Presque Isle Air Base in Maine headed for the U.K.  What followed was a harrowing and life-threatening landing of the entire squadron on a remote ice cap in Greenland. Miraculously, none of the crew was lost and they were all rescued and returned safely home after spending several days on the desolate ice.

Fifty years later a small group of aviation enthusiasts decided to locate those aircraft, which had come to be known as &quot;The Lost Squadron,&quot; and to recover one of the lost P-38s.  It turned out to be no easy task, as the planes had been buried under 25 stories of ice and drifted over a mile from their original location.

===Richard Bong and Thomas McGuire===
[[File:Richard Bong in cockpit.jpg|thumb|Major [[Richard Bong]] in his P-38.]]

The American ace of aces and his closest competitor both flew Lightnings as they tallied 40 and 38 victories respectively. Majors [[Richard Bong|Richard I. &quot;Dick&quot; Bong]] and [[Thomas McGuire|Thomas B. &quot;Tommy&quot; McGuire]] of the [[USAAF]] competed for the top position. Both men were awarded the [[Medal of Honor]].

McGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the [[Philippines]], after racking up 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America's ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] jet fighter flamed out on [[takeoff]].

[[File:Thomas B. McGuire (L) and Charles Lindbergh (R).jpg|thumb|upright|(L-R) [[Thomas B. McGuire]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]] discussing a mission on Bial Island in July 1944.]]

===Charles Lindbergh===
The famed aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] toured the South Pacific as a civilian contractor for [[United Aircraft and Transport Corporation|United Aircraft Corporation]], comparing and evaluating performance of single- and twin-engined fighters for [[Vought]]. He worked to improve range and load limits of the [[Vought F4U Corsair]], flying both routine and combat strafing missions in Corsairs alongside [[United States Marine Corps Aviation|Marine]] pilots.

Everywhere Lindbergh went in the South Pacific, he was accorded the normal preferential treatment of a visiting colonel, although he had resigned his Air Corps Reserve colonel's commission three years before. In Hollandia, Lindbergh attached himself to the 475th FG, flying P-38s. Although new to the aircraft, Lindbergh was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600&amp;nbsp;rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at {{convert|185|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] which reduced fuel consumption to 70&amp;nbsp;gal/h, about 2.6&amp;nbsp;mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous and would upset the fuel mixture, causing an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland 2003, pp. 29–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

While with the 475th, he held training classes and took part in a number of Army Air Corps combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a [[Mitsubishi Ki-51]] &quot;Sonia&quot; flown expertly by the veteran commander of 73rd Independent Flying [[Chutaicho|Chutai]], [[Imperial Japanese Army]] Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada's apparent head-on [[Aerial ramming|ramming attack]]. Hit by cannon and machine gun fire, the &quot;Sonia's&quot; propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged &quot;Sonia&quot; went into a steep dive, hit the ocean and sank. Lindbergh's wingman, ace Joseph E. &quot;Fishkiller&quot; Miller, Jr., had also scored hits on the &quot;Sonia&quot; after it had begun its fatal dive, but Miller was certain the kill credit was Lindbergh's. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th's war record. On 12 August 1944, Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleslindbergh.com/wwii/ &quot;Charles Lindbergh and the 475th Fighter Group.&quot;]  ''Lightning Strikes''.

===Charles MacDonald===
The seventh-ranking American ace, [[Charles H. MacDonald]], flew a Lightning against the Japanese, scoring 27 kills in his famous aircraft, the ''Putt Putt Maru''.

===Robin Olds===
{{Main|Robin Olds}}
Robin Olds was the last P-38 ace in the Eighth Air Force and the last in the ETO. Flying a P-38J, he downed five German fighters on two separate missions over France and Germany. He subsequently transitioned to P-51s to make seven more kills. After World War II, he flew [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4 Phantom II]]s in Vietnam, ending his career as brigadier general with 16 kills.

Ross is a decorated World War II pilot who flew 96 missions for the U.S. Army Air Corps under the U.S. 8th Air Force's [[7th Reconnaissance Group]] in the [[22nd Reconnaissance Squadron]]. Ross flew the Lockheed P-38 Lightning as a photo-reconnaissance pilot out of [[RAF Mount Farm]] in England during the war. He received 11 medals and was awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] twice for missions that were integral to Allied victory at the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

At the midday of 31 July 1944, the noted aviation pioneer and writer [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]] (''[[Night Flight (novel)|Night Flight]]'', ''[[Wind, Sand and Stars]]'' and ''[[The Little Prince]]'') vanished in his P-38 of the [[French Air Force|French ''Armée de l'Air's'']] ''Groupe de Chasse II/33'', after departing [[Borgo-Porreta]], [[Corsica]]. His health, both physically and mentally, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exupéry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and there had been talk of taking him off flying status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiff-b&quot;&gt;Schiff 1994, pp. 430–433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schiff-c&quot;&gt;Schiff 1994, pp. 436–437.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Saint-Exupéry suffered recurring pain and immobility from previous injuries due to his numerous aircraft crashes, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit.

[[Harley Earl]] arranged for several of his designers to view a YP-38 prototype shortly before World War II, and its design directly inspired the tail fins of the 1948–1949 [[Cadillac]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of Automotive Style&quot;&gt;Holls and  Lamm 1996, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

The P-38 was also the inspiration for [[Raymond Loewy]] and his design team at [[Studebaker]] for the 1950 and 1951 model-year Studebakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hemmings Motor News&quot;&gt;''[http://www.hemmings.com/hmn/stories/2006/08/01/hmn_feature22.html &quot;The P-38 prowls the highway.&quot;] ''Hemmings Motor News'', courtesy of Studebaker. Retrieved: 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The whine of the [[speeder bike]] engines in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' was partly achieved by recording the engine noise of a P-38, combined with that of a [[North American P-51 Mustang]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmsound.org/starwars/ &quot;Sound Design of Star Wars.&quot;] ''filmsound.org,'' 3 January 2012.

[[Image:Maria Magdalene praying.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mary Magdalene]] by [[Ary Scheffer]] (1795–1858).]]

'''Prayer''' is an [[invocation]] or act that seeks to activate a  [[rapport]] with a deity, an object of worship, or a spiritual entity through deliberate communication. Prayer can be a form of [[Religious_behaviour#Religious_actions|religious practice]],  may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words or song. When [[language]] is used, prayer may take the form of a [[hymn]], [[incantation]], formal [[creed]], or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. There are different forms of prayer such as [[petition]]ary prayer, prayers of [[supplication]], thanksgiving, and [[worship]]/praise. Prayer may be directed towards a [[deity]], spirit, deceased person, or lofty idea, for the purpose of worshipping, requesting [[counseling|guidance]], requesting assistance, confessing [[sin]]s or to express one's thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit or for the sake of others. [[Yoga]] is also a common form of prayer.

Most major [[religion]]s involve prayer in one way or another. Some ritualize the act of prayer, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practiced spontaneously by anyone at any time.

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the studies in this field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is &quot;no discernable effect&quot; while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had &quot;small, but significant, effect sizes&quot; but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref&gt;K. Masters, G. Spielmans, J. Goodson &quot;Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review.&quot; ''[[Annals of Behavioral Medicine]]'' 2006 Aug;32(1):21-6.

Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, graces said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] regard dancing as a form of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Littlebird|first= Sarracina|title =Sacred Movement: Dance as Prayer in the Pueblo Cultures of the American Southwest |publisher=Barnard College Department of Dance|year=2008|url=http://dance.barnard.edu/sites/default/files/inline/sarracina_littlebird.pdf|accessdate=11 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Jewish prayer may involve [[Shuckling|swaying]] back and forth and bowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Jewish Worship and Prayer|work=Religion Facts| url = http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/practices/worship_prayer.htm| accessdate = 12-4-2008}} This practice is known, in [[Yiddish]], as ''shuckling''.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Muslims]] practice ''[[salah]]'' (kneeling and [[prostration]]) in their prayers. Quakers keep silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Avery|first=Chel|title=Quaker Worship|publisher=Quaker Information Center| url = http://www.quakerinfo.org/quakerism/worship.html|accessdate=12-4-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.

These methods show a variety of understandings to prayer, which are led by underlying beliefs.

These beliefs may be that
*the finite can communicate with the infinite
*the infinite is interested in communicating with the finite
*prayer is intended to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, rather than to influence the recipient
*prayer is intended to train a person to focus on the recipient through philosophy and intellectual contemplation
*prayer is intended to enable a person to gain a direct experience of the recipient
*prayer is intended to affect the very fabric of reality as we perceive it

==The act of worship==
{{See also|Worship}}
Prayer has many different forms. Prayer may be done privately and individually, or it may be done corporately in the presence of fellow believers. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily &quot;thought life&quot;, in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations,&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{cite web| last=Knight|first=Kevin|authorlink=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Prayer|publisher=New Advent|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12345b.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; although enforcement is not possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer.&lt;ref name=catholic/&gt; Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.
Some outward acts that sometimes accompany prayer are: anointing with oil;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{bibleverse||James|5:14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ringing a bell;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scheckel|first=Roger J.|title=The Angelus| publisher = The Marian Catechists|date=January 2004|url= http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm|accessdate=2008-10-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080623093915/http://www.mariancatechist.com/html/spiritualdevelopment/prayer/sanctifyingyourdaywiththeangelus.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-23}}

&lt;/ref&gt; or the East); making the [[sign of the cross]]. One less noticeable act related to prayer is [[fasting]].

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously as they are prayed. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may be with musical accompaniment or not. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Pre-Christian Europe==
===Etruscan, Greek, and Roman paganism===
In the pre-Christian religions of Greeks and Romans ([[Ancient Greek religion]], [[religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]), ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and [[ritual]]ized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rayor|first=Diane|title=The Homeric Hymns| publisher=University of California Press|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/books/pages/9232/9232.intro.php| accessdate=2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religio Romana|publisher=Nova Roma|url=http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/posture.html|accessdate=2009-01-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Iguvine Tables]] contain a supplication that can be translated, &quot;If anything was said improperly, if anything was done improperly, let it be as if it were done correctly.&quot;

The formalism and formulaic nature of these prayers led them to be written down in language that may have only been partially understood by the writer, and our texts of these prayers may in fact be garbled. Prayers in [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] were used in the Roman world by [[augur]]s and other [[oracle]]s long after Etruscan became a dead language. The [[Carmen Arvale]] and the [[Carmen Saliare]] are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes, and whose language is full of [[archaism]]s and difficult passages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic de Forest Allen]], ''Remnants of Early Latin'' (Boston: Ginn &amp; Heath 1880 and Ginn &amp; Co 1907).&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman prayers and [[sacrifice]]s were often envisioned as [[religious law|legal]] bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#do ut des|do ut des]]'': &quot;I give, so that you may give.&quot; [[Cato the Elder]]'s treatise on [[agriculture]] contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.&lt;ref&gt;Cato's Mars Prayer, found in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]'', translated at [http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/iedocctr/ie-texts/Mars-prayer.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germanic paganism===
[[Image:Ring48.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] says a [[Norse paganism|pagan Norse]] prayer in ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]''. Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]].]]
An amount of accounts of prayers to the [[Æsir|gods]] in [[Germanic paganism]] survived the process of [[Christianization]], though only a single prayer has survived without the interjection of Christian references. This prayer is recorded in stanzas 2 and 3 of the poem ''[[Sigrdrífumál]]'', compiled in the 13th century ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' from earlier traditional sources, where the [[valkyrie]] [[Sigrdrífa]] prays to the gods and the [[Jörð|earth]] after being woken by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe25.htm Translation by Bellows.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A prayer to the bigger god [[Odin]] is mentioned in chapter 2 of the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'' where King [[Rerir]] prays for a child. His prayer is answered by [[Frigg]], wife of Odin, who sends him an [[apple]], which is dropped on his lap by Frigg's servant in the form of a crow while Rerir is sitting on a [[tumulus|mound]]. Rerir's wife eats the apple and is then pregnant with the hero [[Völsung]]. In stanza 9 of the poem ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]'', a prayer is made to &quot;kind [[Vættir|wights]], Frigg and [[Freyja]], and many gods,&quot; although since the poem is often considered one of the youngest poems in the Poetic Edda, the passage has been the matter of some debate.&lt;ref name=GRUNDY60&gt;[[Stephan Grundy|Grundy, Stephan]] (1998). &quot;Freyja and Frigg&quot; as collected in Billington, Sandra. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;printsec=frontcover The Concept of the Goddess]'', p. 60. [[Routledge]] ISBN 0-415-19789-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 21 of ''[[Jómsvíkinga saga]]'', wishing to turn the tide of the [[Battle of Hjörungavágr]], [[Haakon Sigurdsson]] eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses [[Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa]] (the first of the two described as Haakon's patron goddess) who appear in the battle, kill many of the opposing fleet, and cause the remnants of their forces to flee. However, this depiction of a pagan prayer has been criticized as inaccurate due to the description of Haakon dropping to his knees.&lt;ref name=HOLLANDER100&gt;Hollander, Lee (trans.) (1955). ''The saga of the Jómsvíkings'', p. 100. [[University of Texas Press]] ISBN 0-292-77623-3&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th-century manuscript for the [[Anglo-Saxon]] charm ''[[Æcerbot]]'' presents what is thought to be an originally [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|pagan]] prayer for the fertility of the speaker's crops and land, though Christianization is apparent throughout the charm.&lt;ref name=GORDON88-90&gt;Gordon, R.K. (1962). Anglo-Saxon Poetry. Everyman's Library #794. M. Dent &amp; Sons, LTD.&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th-century [[Wessobrunn Prayer]] has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan ''[[Völuspá]]''&lt;ref name=LAMBDIN227&gt;Lambdin, Laura C and Robert T. (2000). ''Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature'', p. 227. Greenwood Publishing Group ISBN 0-313-30054-2&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Merseburg Incantations]], the latter recorded in the 9th or 10th century but of much older traditional origins.&lt;ref name=WELLS51&gt;Wells, C. J.&quot; (1985). ''German, a Linguistic History to 1945: A Linguistic History to 1945'', p  51. [[Oxford University Press]] ISBN 0-19-815795-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abrahamic religions==
===Bible===
In the common [[Bible]] of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, various forms of prayer appear; the most common forms being [[petition]], [[thanksgiving]], and [[worship]]. The longest book in the Bible is the [[Book of Psalms]], 150 religious songs which are often regarded as prayers. Other well-known Biblical prayers include the [[Song of Moses]] (Exodus 15:1–18), the [[Song of Hannah]] (1 Samuel 2:1–10), and the [[Magnificat]] (Luke 1:46–55). But perhaps the best-known prayer in the Christian Bible is the [[Lord's Prayer]] (Matthew 6:9–13; Luke 11:2–4).

===Judaism===
{{Main|Jewish prayer}}
[[Image:Jewish Canadian soldiers during WWII.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Captain Samuel Cass, a rabbi, conducting the first prayer service celebrated on German territory by Jewish personnel of the 1st Canadian Army near Cleve, Germany, 18 March 1945.]]
Observant Jews pray three times a day, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Arvit]] with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]] including [[Musaf]] and the reading of the [[Torah]]. The [[siddur]] is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: ''[[kavanah]]'' (intention) and ''keva'' (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the [[Shema Yisrael]] (&quot;Hear O Israel&quot;) and the [[Amidah]] (&quot;the standing prayer&quot;).

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of 10 adult males (a [[minyan]]) is considered by [[Orthodox Judaism]] a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
[[Image:Women praying in the Western Wall tunnels by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Orthodox Jewish]] women praying in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Western Wall tunnel]]]]

There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach to prayer====
In this view, ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists.  One example of this approach to prayer is noted by [[Rabbi Steven Weil]], who was appointed the Orthodox Union's Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word “prayer” is a derivative of the Latin “precari”, which means “to beg”.  The Hebrew equivalent “tefilah”, however, along with its root “pelel” or its reflexive “l’hitpallel”, means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ou.org/torah/article/why_tefilah_doesn&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/862308/jewish/Jewish-Prayer.htm Jewish Prayer] from Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

====Educational approach to prayer====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, [[Yehuda Halevy]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph Dov Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] Siddur (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach to prayer====
[[Kabbalah]] (Jewish mysticism) uses a series of kavanot, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/114937/jewish/The-Kabbalah.htm The Kabbalah of Prayer] on Chabad.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz]] (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the [[Isaac Luria|Arizal's]] Kabbalist tradition, [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto|Ramchal]], most of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], the [[Vilna Gaon]], and [[Jacob Emden]].

===Christianity===
{{Main|Prayer in Christianity|Christian worship}}
[[File:Pilgrim praying in front of icon of Saint Mary.jpg|thumb|Orthodox pilgrim praying in front of icon of Saint Mary in [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], Ukraine.]]
[[Image:Panagia.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]]-style bronze [[panagia]] from [[Jerusalem]], showing the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] in the [[orans]] prayer posture.]]

Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican [[Book of Common Prayer]]. The most common prayer among Christians is the [[Lord's Prayer]], which according to the [[gospel]] accounts (e.g. [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#6:9|Matthew 6:9–13]]) is how [[Jesus]] taught his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] to pray.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 &gt;''Examining Religions: Christianity Foundation Edition'' by Anne Geldart 1999 ISBN 0-435-30324-4 page 108&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord's prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.&lt;ref name=Geldart108 /&gt;

Christians generally pray to God or to the Father. Some Christians (e.g., [[Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]) will also ask the righteous in heaven and &quot;in Christ,&quot; such as [[Virgin Mary]] or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf ([[intercession of saints]]). Formulaic closures include &quot;through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages,&quot; and &quot;in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&quot;

It is customary among Protestants to end prayers with &quot;In [[Jesus]]' name, Amen&quot; or &quot;In the name of [[Christ]], Amen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See John 16:23, 26; John 14:13; John 15:16&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most commonly used closure in Christianity is simply &quot;[[Amen]]&quot; (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as ''so be it'').

In the Western or [[Latin Rite]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]], probably the most common is the [[Rosary]]; In the Eastern Church (the [[Eastern Rite Catholic Churches|Eastern rites]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and Orthodox Church), the [[Jesus Prayer]]. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the [[Christian meditation|meditative]] [[hesychasm]] practice in [[Eastern Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Parry, Ken; David Melling (editors) (1999). ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Eastern Christianity'' ISBN 0-631-23203-6 page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins of others'', e.g. for the [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ|repair of the sin of blasphemy]] performed by others.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Encyclopedia http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of prayer among Catholic's would be meditative prayer, contemplative prayer and infused prayer discussed at length by Catholic Saint's St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Jesus.   

====Pentecostalism====
In [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations, prayer is often done by speaking in a foreign tongue, a practice now known as [[glossolalia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], 2nd ed, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the [[Holy Spirit]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christianity - Pentecostalism|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Company|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/stories/s820631.htm|accessdate=12-5-2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Acts|2:1-13|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, many people outside the movement have offered alternative views. [[George Barton Cutten]] suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;George Barton Cutten, ''Speaking with Tongues Historically and Psychologically Considered'', Yale University Press, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felicitas Goodman]] suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Felicitas D., ''Speaking in Tongues: A Cross-Cultural Study in Glossolalia''. University of Chicago Press, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.' ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 8, 2: (1969) 211–26: quote on p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samarin, William J., ''Tongues of Men and Angels: The Religious Language of Pentecostalism''. Macmillan, New York, 1972, quote on p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, Virginia H.: 'Pentecostal Glossolalia toward a Functional Interpretation.' ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 8, 2: (1969) 211–26: quote on p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanos, Nicholas P.; Hewitt, Erin C.: Glossolalia: 'A test of the 'trance' and psychopathology hypotheses.' ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'': 1979 Aug Vol 88(4) 427–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====

[[Christian Science]] teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality (the &quot;[[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]&quot; in Biblical terms) into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Baker Eddy]], &quot;Prayer,&quot; in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Boston, Trustees Under the Will of Mary Baker Eddy, 1934 [etc.]pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt; Christian Scientists do not practice [[intercessory prayer]] as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. (However, the choice of healing method is regarded as a matter for the individual, and the Christian Science Church exerts no pressure on members to avoid medical treatment if they wish to avail of it as an alternative to Christian Science healing.{{citation needed|date = February 2012}}) Prayer works through [[love]]: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Christian Science Q&amp;A|title=Is there no intercessory prayer?|url=http://www.christianscience.org/QAIsthereintercesprayer.html|accessdate=2007-10-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence of prayer for health====
Some modalities of [[alternative medicine]] employ prayer. A [http://nccam.nih.gov/news/camsurvey.htm survey released in May 2004] by the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others' health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

===Islam===
:''Main article: [[Salah]] and [[Dua]]''
[[File:Muslim men praying in Afghanistan-2010.jpg|thumb|right|Muslim men praying in [[Afghanistan]].]]
[[Image:Great Mosque of Kairouan, prayer hall.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Prayer hall of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] (also called Mosque of Uqba) which is situated in the city of Kairouan in [[Tunisia]]. At the bottom of the central nave of the prayer hall there is a niche (the mihrab) which indicates the direction of the prayer.]]
[[Muslim]]s pray a ritualistic prayer called ''[[salah]]'' or ''salat'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], facing the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]], five times a day. The command to ritual prayer is in the Quran in several chapters. The prophet Muhammed showed each Muslim the true method of offering ritual prayers thus the same method is observed till date. There is the &quot;call for prayer&quot; (''[[adhan]]''), where the ''[[muezzin]]'' calls for all the followers to stand together for the ritual prayer. The prayer consists of standing, by mentioning ‘Allāhu akbar’ (Allāh is Great) followed by recitation of the first chapter of the Quran. Afterwards the person bends and praises God, then [[prostration|prostrates themself]] and again praises God. The prayer ends with the following words: &quot;Peace be with you and God’s mercy&quot;. During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides praying. Certain Shia sects combine the 5 prayers into 3 times a day, providing several hadith as supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UlaBw3MUGBEC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=shia+pray+3+times&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=urkrTeT9MM6IhQeAwrydCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Muslim cultures today: a reference guide] By Kathryn M. Coughlin, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the ritual prayer ''(salah)'' is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs. These are called [[dua]]. There are many standard invocations in [[Arabic]] to be recited at various times, ''e.g.'' for one's parents, after salah, before eating. Muslims may also say ''dua'' in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers.&lt;ref name=Emerick/&gt;

===Bahá'í===
{{Main|Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith}}
[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the [[Báb]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] have revealed many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]]s are also required to recite each day one of three [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayers]] revealed by [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the [[Qiblih]] when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Bahá'ís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=P.|year=1999|title =A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith|publisher=Oneworld Publications|location=Oxford, UK|pages=274–75|isbn=1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eastern religions==
In contrast with [[Western religion]], [[Eastern religion]] for the most part discards [[worship]] and places devotional emphasis on the practice of [[meditation]] alongside scriptural study. Consequently, prayer is seen as a form of meditation or an adjunct practice to meditation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Buddhism===
[[Image:Incense-LE.jpg|right|thumb|[[Buddhism|Buddhists]] praying at [[Wat Phra Kaew]], [[Thailand]].]]
In certain Buddhist sects, prayer accompanies [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. [[Buddhism]] for the most part sees prayer as a secondary, supportive practice to meditation and [[Dharma (Buddhism)|scriptural study]]. [[Gautama Buddha]] claimed that human beings possess the capacity and potential to become liberated, or [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]], through [[contemplation]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Bhavana|bhāvana]]'' and ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]]''), leading to [[Vipassanā|insight]]. Prayer is seen mainly as a powerful psycho-physical practice that can enhance meditation.&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://www.centreguephel.org/prieres.html {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the [[Theravada]], and in the later [[Mahayana]] tradition of [[Zen]] (or [[Chán]]), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dizang.org/dzfm/qt21.htm 常用回向偈、回向文]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tw.myblog.yahoo.com/avalokiteshvara-ommanipadmehum/article?mid=141 常用迴向偈合輯]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.netvigator.com/~jalee/budd_text01.html 懺悔、禮拜、發願、回向文]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Collins|first=Steven|title=Selfless Persons|publisher=Cambridge University Press| year=1982|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=6|isbn=0-521-39726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upāya|skillful means]] (Sanskrit: ''upāya'') of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: ''[[pariṇāmanā]]'') is an [[evocation]] and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: ''buddha-kshetra'').

The ''[[Trikaya|nirmānakāya]]'' of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a [[mandala]]. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: ''maṇḍala'') is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] is not just cultivated but ''is''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=Bhikshu|title=A Survey of Buddhism|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|location=Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom|pages=449–60|isbn=0-904766-65-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common prayer is  &quot;May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas' Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below.

The [[Generation Stage]] (Sanskrit: ''utpatti-krama'') of Vajrayana involves prayer elements.&lt;ref&gt;Keown, Damien (ed.) with Hodge, Stephen; Jones, Charles; Tinti, Paola (2003). ''A Dictionary of Buddhism''. Great Britain, Oxford: Oxford University Press. P.100. ISBN 0-19-860560-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tibetan Buddhism]] tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as [[guru yoga]] which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or [[yidam]] are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: ''santana''; refer [[mindstream]]) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage ''yidam'' or [[tutelary deities]] will depend upon the level or more appropriately ''[[yana (Buddhism)|yana]]'' at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is ''[[śūnyatā]]''. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

[[Pure Land Buddhism]] emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like [[mantra]]s, a practice often called [[Nembutsu]].&lt;ref name=smithnovak03&gt;&quot;The Flowering of Faith: Buddhism's Pure Land Tradition&quot; (pp. 185–98) in {{cite book

According to [[Shinran]], the founder of the [[Pure Land Buddhism]] tradition that is most prevalent in the US,&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|193}}&lt;ref&gt;Smith and Novak (2003) state that &quot;Pure Land Buddhism has entered America almost exclusively from Japan, and the church Shinran founded is the largest Pure Land presence on this continent&quot; (p. 193).&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the [[Nembutsu]].&quot;&lt;ref name=smithnovak03/&gt;{{rp|197}}&lt;ref&gt;This quotation is Smith and Novak's paraphrase of Shinran's teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Prayer in Hinduism}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Bangladesh Prayer.jpg|thumb|Shakta Hindus in [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, pray to the goddess during ''[[Durga Puja]]'', October 2003.]]
[[Hinduism]] has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: ''prārthanā''), from fire-based [[yajna|rituals]] to philosophical musings. While chanting involves 'by dictum' recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, dhyanam involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as devtas, trinity or incarnation of either devtas or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. All of these are directed to fulfilling personal needs or deep spiritual enlightenment. Ritual [[invocation]] was part and parcel of the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic religion]] and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the [[Vedas]], are a large collection of [[mantra]]s and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, [[Brahman]], that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the [[Hindu pantheon]]{{Dubious|date=February 2009}}. Hindus in [[India]] have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to Its three manifestations namely creator god called [[Brahma (god)|Brahma]], preserver god called [[Vishnu]] and destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) [[Shiva]], and at the next level to Vishnu's avatars (earthly appearances) [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]] or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined together in ''[[pranam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=a5732hIV03kC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Stephen Jacobs (2010), ''Hinduism Today : An Introduction'', Continuum International Publishing Group, p. 44]&lt;/ref&gt; The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting ''[[namaste]]''.

===Jainism===
Although [[Jainism]] believes that no spirit or divine being can assist them on their path, these figures do hold some influence on believers, and on special occasions, Jains will pray for right knowledge to the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s or sometimes to deities such as [[Ganesha]] or protectors such as the [[Yaksha]]s and [[Yakshini]]s.

===Shinto===
{{Main|Shinto|Ema (Shintō)}}
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Shintō prayer.jpg|thumb|A man praying at a [[Japan]]ese [[Shinto shrine]].]]
The practices involved in [[Shinto]] prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; Japanese Buddhism has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn. The most common and basic form of devotion involves throwing a coin, or several, into a collection box, ringing a bell, clapping one's hands, and contemplating one's wish or prayer silently. The bell and hand clapping are meant to wake up or attract the attention of the ''[[kami]]'' of the shrine, so that one's prayer may be heard.

Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the ''kami'', rather than lengthy praises or devotions. Unlike in certain other faiths, it is not considered irregular or inappropriate to ask favors of the ''kami'' in this way, and indeed many shrines are associated with particular favors, such as success on exams.

In addition, one may write one's wish on a small wooden tablet, called an ''[[ema (Shintō)|ema]]'', and leave it hanging at the [[Shinto shrine|shrine]], where the ''kami'' can read it. If the wish is granted, one may return to the shrine to leave another ''ema'' as an act of thanksgiving.

===Sikhism===
[[Image:BhaiSahibJiArdas.jpg|thumb|160px|A Sikh holy man, doing Sikh Prayer ([[Ardās]])]]
The [[Ardās]] (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a [[Sikh]] prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily [[Banis]] (prayers); or completion of a service like the [[Paath]] (scripture reading/recitation), [[kirtan]] (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The Ardas is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the Ardas is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, [[Guru Gobind Singh]]. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like &quot;[[Waheguru]] please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake&quot; when starting a new task or &quot;[[Akal Purakh]], having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times&quot;, etc. The word &quot;Ardās&quot; is derived from Persian word 'Arazdashat', meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

Ardās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.&lt;ref&gt;www.sgpc.net/ardas/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
Prayer in Taoism is less common than [[Fulu]], which is the drawing and writing of supernatural talismans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.8763456.com/2004/12-18/15183458963.html Chapter IV: Category of fierce types of spells for explanation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20tv.cn/showart.asp?art_id=331&amp;page=1 神咒集合]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
===Wicca===
Wiccan prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Prayers are seen as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. This may include prayers for esbat and sabbat celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for your own or others safety, for healing or for the dead.&lt;ref&gt;The Wiccan Prayer Book: Daily, Mark Ventimiglia - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raelism===
In [[Raelism]] rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies, to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies are performed on certain special days on the Raelian calender.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Susan J., Aliens Adored. Rutgers University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Raël, Sensual Meditation. Tagman Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eckankar===
In [[Eckankar]], one of the basic forms of prayer includes the singing of the word &quot;HU&quot; which is pronounced as &quot;hue&quot;, the holy name of God. This can be done with closed eyes, and loud or silent. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Eckankar: Ancient Wisdom for Today - Page 20, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animism==
{{Main|Animism|Shamanism}}
Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in [[animism]], communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a [[shaman]] who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits' thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using [[astrology]] or contemplating [[Fortune telling|fortune tellers]] and healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omf.org/omf/cambodia/about_cambodia/animism_profile|publisher=OMF|title=Animism Profile in Cambodia|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The native religions in some parts of North, East and South Asia, [[Americas|America]], [[Africa]], and [[Oceania]] are often animistic.

===America===
{{Main|Aztec religion}}
The Aztec religion was not strictly animist. It had an ever increasing pantheon of deities, and the shamans performed ritual prayer to these deities in their respective temples. These shamans made petitions to the proper deities in exchange for a sacrifice offering: food, flowers, effigies, and animals, usually quail. But the larger the thing required from the God the larger the sacrifice had to be, and for the most important rites one would offer one's own blood; by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, and often a human life; either warrior, slave, or even self-sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassig|first=Ross|title=El sacrificio y las guerras floridas|journal=[[Arqueología mexicana]]|volume=XI|pages=47|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo]] Indians are known to have used [[prayer stick]]s, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The [[Hopi]] Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Prayer stick|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian Aboriginal mythology|Dreamtime}}
In [[Australia]], prayers to the &quot;Great Wit&quot; are performed by the &quot;clever wapmen&quot; and &quot;clever women&quot;, or ''kadji''. These [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] shamans use [[maban]] or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their purported magical powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elkin|first=Adolphus P.|title=Aboriginal Men of High Degree: Initiation and Sorcery in the World's Oldest Tradition|publisher=Inner Traditions - Bear &amp; Company|year=1973|isbn=0-89281-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neopaganism==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
Adherents to forms of modern [[Neopaganism]] pray to various gods. The most commonly worshiped and prayed to gods are those of Pre-Christian Europe, such as [[Celtic Mythology|Celtic]], [[Norse Mythology|Norse]], or [[Greek Mythology|Graeco-Roman]] gods. Prayer can vary from sect to sect, and with some (such as Wicca) prayer may also be associated with ritual [[magick (Aleister Crowley)|magick]].

==Theurgy and Western esotericism==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
Practitioners of [[theurgy]] and [[western esotericism]] may practice a form of ritual which utilizes both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers &quot;from the heart&quot; that, when combined, allows the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very similar to hermetic qabala, and orthodox [[qabala]], it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the [[Inner God]], or another spiritual being, and the &quot;prayer from the heart&quot; to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.

==Approaches to prayer==
[[Image:Albrecht Dürer Betende Hände.jpg|thumb|upright|''Praying Hands'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]] showing the hand position of a medieval [[commendation ceremony]].]]

===Direct petitions to God===
From Biblical times to today, the most common form of prayer is to directly appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Moshe. Biblical Prose Prayer: As a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel. Berkeley: University of California Press, c1983 [http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft8b69p1w7/]&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to answer in the way one asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi [[Yehuda Halevi]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], and [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]. This view is expressed by Rabbi [[Nosson Scherman]] in the overview to the [[Artscroll]] [[Siddur]] (p.&amp;nbsp;XIII).

Among Christian theologians, [[Edward McKendree Bounds|E.M. Bounds]] stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, ''The Necessity of Prayer''. Prayer books such as the [[Book of Common Prayer]] are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bounds|first=Edward McKendree|title=The Necessity of Prayer|publisher=AGES Software|year=1907|isbn=0-8010-0659-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
Among Muslim theologians.... (please add examples here).
--&gt;

===Rationalist approach===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher [[Maimonides]] and the other medieval rationalists; it became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

===Experiential approach===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], this approach is known as [[hesychasm]]. It is also widespread in [[Sufi]] Islam, and in some forms of [[mysticism]]. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve [[contemplation]], although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.

===Transformative approach===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
In this approach, prayer enables an existential transformation in the person praying. The act of praying elicits a new kind of understanding which wasn't apparent before praying. The Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] wrote that &quot;the function of prayer is not to influence God, but rather to change the nature of the one who prays.&quot;

==Prayer groups==
A prayer group is a group of people that meet to pray together. These groups, formed mostly within Christian congregations but occasionally among Muslim groups as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Islamic Prayer Group (U.K)|title=Islamicprayergroup.com|year=2008|url=http://islamicprayergroup.com|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather outside of the congregation's regular worship service to pray for perceived needs, sometimes within the congregation, sometimes within their religious group at large. However, these groups often pray also for the world around them, including people who do not share their beliefs.

Many prayer group meetings are held according to a regular schedule, usually once a week. However, extraordinary events, such as the [[September 11 attacks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WWPG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wide Prayer Group|url=http://www.worldwideprayergroup.org|accessdate=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or major disasters spawned a number of improvised prayer group meetings. Prayer groups do not need to meet in person, and there are a vast array of single-purpose prayer groups in the world.

==Prayer healing==
{{main|Faith healing}}
Prayer is often used as a means of [[faith healing]] in an attempt to use [[religious]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]] means to prevent illness, cure [[disease]], or improve health. Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/pell-adamant-prayer-cures-cancer-20091221-l8fy.html|location=Melbourne|work=The Age|title=Pell adamant prayer cures cancer|date=2009-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden &quot;miracle cure&quot;, and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
{{main|Efficacy of prayer}}

In 1872, [[Francis Galton]] conducted a famous [[statistics|statistical]] experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Galton&quot;/&gt; While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of [[Confounding variable|confounders]], it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened.&lt;ref&gt;http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/07/prayer_still_us.html Prayer still useless&lt;/ref&gt; One such study, with a [[double-blind]] design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population.&lt;ref name=&quot;SouthMedJ&quot;/&gt; Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infidels&quot;/&gt; Another such study was reported by Harris et al.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris&quot;/&gt; Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began,&lt;ref&gt;Tessman I and Tessman J &quot;Efficacy of Prayer: A Critical Examination of Claims,&quot; Skeptical Inquirer, March/April 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990–96, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.&lt;ref&gt;Leibovici L. Effects of remote, retroactive intercessory prayer on outcomes in patients with bloodstream infection: randomized controlled trial. ''BMJ'' 2001;323:1450-1. {{DOI|10.1136/bmj.323.7327.1450}} PMID 11751349.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Laoire&quot;/&gt; A 2001 double-blind study of the [[Mayo Clinic]] found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not.&lt;ref&gt;Aviles JM, Whelan SE, Hernke DA, Williams BA, Kenny KE, O'Fallon WM, Kopecky SL. Intercessory prayer and cardiovascular disease progression in a coronary care unit population: a randomized controlled trial. ''Mayo Clin Proc'' 2001;76:1192-8. PMID 11761499.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;Krucoff MW, Crater SW, Gallup D, Blankenship JC, Cuffe M, Guarneri M, Krieger RA, Kshettry VR, Morris K, Oz M, Pichard A, Sketch MH Jr, Koenig HG, Mark D, Lee KL.

PMID 16023511.&lt;/ref&gt; In another similar study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: A multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer [http://www.ahjonline.com/article/PIIS0002870305006496/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name=&quot;STEP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2139373/ The Deity in the DataWhat the latest prayer study tells us about God]&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of [[cardiac bypass]] patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Benson ''et al.'', &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16569567 Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP) in cardiac bypass patients: A multicenter randomized trial of uncertainty and certainty of receiving intercessory prayer]&quot;, American Heart Journal, Volume 151, No 4, 934-42 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See [[Subject-expectancy effect]].) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, &quot;the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrastate.com/body.cfm?id=520&amp;action=detail&amp;articlepath=/Atoz/dc/cen/canc/gen/mindspirit.html#7 Mind and Spirit]. ''from the Health Library section of'' [http://www.centrastate.com CentraState Healthcare System]. Accessed May 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Other practices such as [[yoga]], [[T'ai chi ch'uan|t'ai chi]], and [[meditation]] may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.

Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned American Heart Journal study published in the ''American Heart Journal'' indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them,&lt;ref name=&quot;STEP&quot;/&gt; saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: {{quote|Prior to the start of this study, intercessors reported that they usually receive information about the patient’s age, gender and progress reports on their medical condition; converse with family members or the patient (not by fax from a third party); use individualized prayers of their own choosing; and pray for a variable time period based on patient or family request.}}

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through [[neuroscience]]. Leaders in this movement include [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]], an Associate Professor at the University of Pennsylvania.  In Newberg's brain scans, monks,  priests, nuns and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites.  This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain’s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans' need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume{{page needed|date=September 2010}} the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg's research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg's research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009).  For example, brain activity during [[meditation]] indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation  experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.&lt;ref&gt;Newberg, Andrew.

The influence of Punjabi as a cultural language in the Indian Subcontinent is increasing day by day mainly due to Bollywood. Most Bollywood movies now have Punjabi vocabulary mixed in, along with a few songs fully sung in Punjabi. At any point in time, Punjabi songs in Bollywood movies now account for more than 50% of the top of the charts listings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=221949&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-20/ludhiana/32763334_1_suniel-shetty-punjabi-culture-bollywood-actor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timescrest.com/culture/punjab-gatecrashes-bollywood-7856&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word Punjabi is derived from the word Punjab which is a [[xenonym]]/[[exonym]] introduced during the reign of the [[Mughal empire]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]] and means &quot;five waters&quot; in Persian &quot;''panj aab''&quot;, Panj is also cognate with the [[Sanskrit]] word &quot;panch&quot; meaning &quot;five&quot; and refers to five major eastern tributaries of the [[Indus River]]. The historical [[Punjab region]], now divided between Pakistan and India, is defined physiographically by the [[Indus River]] and these five tributaries. One of the five, the [[Beas River]], is a tributary of another, the [[Sutlej]] River.

There are three ways to write Punjabi - [[Gurmukhi]], [[Shahmukhi]], and [[Devanagari]]. The word Gurmukhi translates into 'Guru's mouth',&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalsa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Khalsa|first=Sukhmandir|title=Introduction to Gurmukhi|url=http://sikhism.about.com/od/learntoreadgurmukhi/tp/gurmukhi_script.htm|work=About.com|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shahmukhi means 'from the King's mouth'&lt;ref name=&quot;Saini, Tejinder 2008 p. 177&quot;&gt;Saini, Tejinder, Lehal Gurpreet, and Kalra Virinder (2008). Shahmukhi to Gurmukhi Transliteration System. p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and Devanagari roughly translated means 'The container of divine light.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Poole|first=Katyayani|title=Devanagari: Sanskrit's Illumined Script|url=http://www.shrutiinc.com/articles/articles_devanagari.html|work=Shruti Institute for Vedic Arts|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Punjabi is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language. It is a descendant of the [[Shauraseni language]], which was the chief language of medieval northern India.&lt;ref&gt;''India's culture through the ages'' by Mohan Lal Vidyarthi. Published by Tapeshwari Sahitya Mandir, 1952. Page 148: &quot;From the apabhramsha of Sauraseni are derived Punjabi, Western Hindi, Rajasthani and Gujerati {{sic}}...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Communication and Language Policy in India By Baldev Raj Nayar.

Two of its descendants are Hindi and Punjabi.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Punjabi emerged as an independent language in the 12th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Fariduddin Ganjshakar]] is generally recognized as the first major poet of the Punjabi language,.&lt;ref name=sikh&gt;[http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/arts/shiv%20batalvi/Shiv%20batalvi.htm Shiv Kumar Batalvi] ''sikh-heritage.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Varan Gyan Ratnavali.jpg|thumb|right|[[Janamsakhis#Bhai Mani Singh’s Janamsakhi|Gyan Ratnavali]], Janamsakhi, written by [[Bhai Mani Singh]]]]

The Sikh religion originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region and Punjabi is the predominant language spoken by the [[Sikhs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most portions of the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] use the Punjabi language written in [[Gurmukhī alphabet|Gurmukhi]], though Punjabi is not the only language used in [[Sikh scriptures]]. The ''[[Janamsakhis]]'', stories on the life and legend of [[Guru Nanak]] (1469–1539), are early examples of Punjabi prose literature. Guru Nanak himself composed Punjabi verse incorporating vocabulary from [[Sanskrit]], [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and other Indic languages as characteristic of the [[Gurbani]] tradition. Punjabi Sufi poetry developed under [[Shah Hussain]] (1538–1599), [[Sultan Bahu]] (1628–1691), Shah Sharaf (1640–1724), Ali Haider (1690–1785), [[Saleh muhammad safoori]] (son of, [[Mai Safoora]] whome Ali Haider had given great tribute) and [[Bulleh Shah]] (1680–1757). In contrast to Persian poets, who had preferred the ''[[ghazal]]'' for poetic expression, Punjabi Sufi poets tended to compose in the ''[[Kafi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apnaorg.com/poetry/bullahn/&lt;/ref&gt;

Punjabi Sufi poetry also influenced other Punjabi literary traditions particularly the [[Punjabi Qissa]], a genre of romantic tragedy which also derived inspiration from Indic, Persian and Quranic sources. The Qissa of ''[[Heer Ranjha]]'' by [[Waris Shah]] (1706–1798) is among the most popular of Punjabi qisse. Other popular stories include ''[[Sohni Mahiwal]]'' by Fazal Shah, ''[[Mirza Sahiba]]'' by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658–1707), ''[[Sassi Punnun]]'' by Hashim Shah (1735?–1843?), and ''Qissa Puran Bhagat'' by [[Qadaryar]] (1802–1892).

Heroic ballads known as ''[[Vaar]]'' enjoy a rich oral tradition in Punjabi. Prominent examples of heroic or epic poetry include [[Guru Gobind Singh]]'s in ''Chandi di Var'' (1666–1708). The semi-historical ''Nadir Shah Di Vaar'' by Najabat describes the invasion of India by Nadir Shah in 1739. The Jangnama, or 'War Chronicle,' was introduced into Punjabi literature during the Mughal period; the Punjabi ''Jangnama'' of [[Shah Mohammad]] (1780–1862) recounts the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845–46.

===Modern Punjabi===
[[File:Punjabi Alphabet.jpg|thumb|[[Gurmukhi]] alphabetic excluding vowels.]]

[[Majhi dialect|Majhi]] standard Punjabi is the written standard for Punjabi in both parts of Punjab. Pakistani Punjabis use the [[Shahmukhī script]], created from a modification of the Persian-Nasta’liq script. In India, Punjabi is one of the 22 [[languages with official status in India]]. It is the first official language of the Indian Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi has not been granted official status though it is the most spoken language and is the provincial language of [[Punjab (Pakistan)]], the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan.

===Official recognition===
Punjabi is one of the languages recognized by the Indian constitution at the state level, in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, and West Bengal. There is no such recognition in Pakistan. According to Dr. Manzur Ejaz, &quot;In Central Punjab, Punjabi is amazingly still neither an official language of the province nor it is used as medium of education at any level in Pakistan. There are only two daily newspapers published in Punjabi in the Central areas of Punjab. Only a few monthly literary magazines constitute Punjabi press in Pakistan&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Punjabi in modern culture===
Punjabi is becoming more acceptable among Punjabis in modern media and communications.  Punjabi has always been an integral part of Indian [[Bollywood]] cinema.  In recent years a trend of Bollywood songs written totally in Punjabi can be observed.  Punjabi pop and folk songs are very popular both in India and Pakistan at the national level.  A number of television dramas based on Punjabi characters are telecast by different channels.  The number of students opting for Punjabi literature has increased in Pakistani Punjab. Punjabi cinema in India has also seen a revival and more and more Punjabi movies are being produced. In India, number of student opting for Punjabi Literature as optional subject in IAS examinations has increased along with success rate of the students.  Punjabi music is very popular in modern times.&lt;ref name=&quot;  news&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sify.com/mobile/movies/balle-balle-punjabi-music-is-flavour-of-bollywood-news-national-ldjjEcbhfef.html |date= 9 March 2011|accessdate= 9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dialects of Punjabi and related languages==
{{Main|Dialects of the Punjab}}
{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}
Punjabi consists of many dialects that form a dialect continuum. The dialects that comprise this continuum eventually merge with Hindi in India and Sindhi in Pakistan. The dialects enjoy a relatively high level of mutual intelligibility and can be differentiated slightly with respect to their lexicons. In India, the key dialects of Punjabi are: Majhi, Doabi, Malwai, and Powadhi. In Pakistan, the key dialects are Majhi, Pothohari, Hindko, and Multani. Following the work presented in Grierson’s (1905) Linguistic Survey of India, a number of Indic scholars have further divided Punjabi into two principal languages – Western Punjabi or Lahnda and Eastern Punjabi. This decision, however, is controversial and by no means reflects the majority view in Indic linguistics.&lt;ref name=&quot;lmp.ucla.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=95&amp;menu=004&lt;/ref&gt; Modern linguists Nataliia Ivanovna Tolstaia write that in practice there is no contrast between Eastern or western Punjabi to the extent that it could be termed as such as different languages and speakers of Eastern or western Punjabi alike use same literary language that is why many Punjabi scholars are inclined to regard both as a form of single language Punjabi.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com.pk&quot;&gt;http://books.google.com.pk/books?id=BmA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indo-Aryan dialectology generally, the presence of transitional dialects creates problems in assigning some dialects to one or another &quot;language&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Masica 1991:25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burling 1970:chapter on India&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shackle 1970:240&quot;&gt;Shackle 1970:240&lt;/ref&gt; Northern dialects Hindko of Hazara/Kohati/Peshaweri and  are now classified as a separate language  [[Hindko language|Hindko]].Jummu's [[Dogri]] is also classified as a separate languages.  Similarly Southern dialects of Western Punjabi (Multani, Derawali and Riasti) are now also classified as a separate language Saraiki. However this sepration is controversial and Saraiki, Hindko and dogri are considered as a dialect of Main stream Punjabi because These are Mutually intangible, Morphologicaly and Syntactically similar with Standard Punjabi and is in fact dialect of Punjabi agreed by majority of local linguists such as Dulai, K Narinder, Gill, Harjeet Singh Gill, A Henry.

;Tone

Punjabi has three phonemically distinct [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]s that developed from the lost [[breathy voice|murmured]] (or &quot;voiced aspirate&quot;) series of consonants. Phonetically the tones are rising or rising-falling contours and they can span over one syllable or two, but phonemically they can be distinguished as high, mid, and low.

A historical murmured consonant (voiced aspirate consonant) in word initial position became [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and left a low tone on the two syllables following it: ''{{Unicode|ghoṛā}}'' {{IPA|[kòːɽɑ̀ː]}} &quot;horse&quot;. A stem final murmured consonant became voiced and left a high tone on the two syllables preceding it: ''{{Unicode|māgh}}'' {{IPA|[mɑ́ːɡ]}} &quot;October&quot;. A stem medial murmured consonant which appeared after a short vowel and before a long vowel became voiced and left a low tone on the two syllables following it: ''{{Unicode|maghāuṇā}}'' {{IPA|[məɡɑ̀ːʊ̀ɳɑ̀ː]}} &quot;to have something lit&quot;. Other syllables and words have mid tone.&lt;ref&gt;Harjeet Singh Gill, &quot;The Gurmukhi Script&quot;, p. 397. In Daniels and Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems.'' 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammar==
{{Main|Punjabi grammar}}
The grammar of the Punjabi language is the study of the word order, case marking, verb conjugation, and other morphological and syntactic structures of the Punjabi language. This main article discusses the grammar of Modern Standard Punjabi as defined by the sources cited therein.

==Writing system==
{{main|Shahmukhī alphabet|Gurmukhī alphabet|Devanagari|Punjabi braille}}
There are three ways to write Punjabi - [[Gurmukhi]], [[Shahmukhi]], and [[Devanagari]]. The word Gurmukhi translates into 'Guru's mouth',&lt;ref name=&quot;Khalsa&quot;/&gt; Shahmukhi means 'from the King's mouth'&lt;ref name=&quot;Saini, Tejinder 2008 p. 177&quot;/&gt; and Devanagari roughly translated means 'The container of divine light.'&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole&quot;/&gt;

In the Punjab province of Pakistan, the script used is [[Shahmukhi script|Shahmukhi]] and differs from the standard [[Nastaʿlīq script]] as it has four additional letters.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA-Orthography of Punjabi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=95&amp;menu=004| title = Punjabi|publisher = [[University of California, Los Angeles]]|accessdate = 2009–10–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[East Punjab|eastern part]] of the [[Punjab region]], located in India, is divided into three states. In the state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], the [[Gurmukhī]] script is generally used for writing Punjabi. Punjabi [[Hindu]]s, who are mainly concentrated in the neighbouring Indian states such as [[Haryana]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]], as well as the national capital territory of [[Delhi]], sometimes use the [[Devanāgarī]] script to write Punjabi.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCLA-Orthography of Punjabi&quot;/&gt;

While Punjabi [[GCSE]] and [[A Level]] qualifications are available to students in the United Kingdom; their written exam is in [[Gurmukhi]] only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.aqa.org.uk/qual/gce/languages/panjabi_materials.php?id=09&amp;prev=09 |title=AQA A-level Panjabi |publisher=Web.aqa.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[abstract algebra]], '''power associativity''' is a property of a [[binary operation]] which is a weak form of [[associativity]].

An [[algebra over a field|algebra]] (or more generally a [[magma (algebra)|magma]]) is said to be power-associative if the [[subalgebra]] generated by any element is associative.
Concretely, this means that if an element ''x'' is multiplied by itself several times, it doesn't matter in which order the multiplications are carried out, so for instance ''x''(''x''(''xx'')) = (''x''(''xx''))''x'' = (''xx'')(''xx'').
This is stronger than merely saying that (''xx'')''x'' = ''x''(''xx'') for every ''x'' in the algebra, but weaker than [[alternativity]] or associativity.

Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously power-associative, but so are all other [[alternative algebra]]s (like the [[octonion]]s, which are non-associative) and even some non-alternative algebras like the [[sedenion]]s and [[Okubo algebra]]s.  Any algebra whose elements are [[idempotent]] is also power-associative.

[[Exponentiation]] to the power of any [[natural number]] other than [[0 (number)|zero]] can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power-associative.
For example, there is no ambiguity as to whether ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; should be defined as (''xx'')''x'' or as ''x''(''xx''), since these are equal.
Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an [[identity element]], so the existence of identity elements becomes especially useful in power-associative contexts.

A nice substitution law holds for real power-associative algebras with unit, which basically asserts that multiplication of polynomials works as expected. For ''f'' a real polynomial in ''x'', and for any ''a'' in such an algebra define ''f''(''a'') to be the element of the algebra resulting from the obvious substitution of ''a'' into ''f''. Then for any two such polynomials ''f'' and ''g'', we have that (''fg'') (''a'') = ''f''(''a'')''g''(''a'').

'''Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin''' ({{IPA-fr|pjɛʁ də kubɛʁtɛ̃}}; 1 January 1863 – 2 September 1937) was a [[France|French]] [[education|educator]] and historian, and founder of the [[International Olympic Committee]]. He is considered the father of the modern [[Olympic Games]]. Born into a [[French people|French]] [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] family, he became an academic and studied a broad range of topics, most notably education and history.

==Early life==
Pierre de Frédy was born in Paris on 1 January 1863 into an established aristocratic family.&lt;ref name=&quot;H5&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; He was the fourth child of Baron [[Charles Louis Frédy, Baron de Coubertin]] and Marie–Marcelle Gigault de Crisenoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roglo.eu/roglo?lang=en&amp;m=A&amp;i=2804697&amp;v=7&amp;sosab=10&amp;siblings=on&amp;notes=on&amp;src=on&amp;t=T&amp;bd=0&amp;color= |title=Ancestry of Pierre de Coubertin |publisher=Roglo.eu |accessdate=9 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family tradition held that the Frédy name had first arrived in France in the early 15th century, and the first recorded title of nobility granted to the family was given by [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] to an ancestor, also named Pierre de Frédy, in 1477. But other branches of his family tree delved even further into French history, and the annals of both sides of his family included nobles of various stations, military leaders, and associates of kings and princes of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;m810&quot;&gt;MacAloon, pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:The young Pierre de Coubertin with his sister.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pierre de Coubertin as a child (right), with one of his sisters, painted by his father [[Charles Louis de Fredy de Coubertin]] (detail of ''Le Départ'', 1869).|alt=A portion of a painting showing a young girl in a red jacket and pleated black skirt with her arm draped over the shoulder of a young boy, who is dressed in a blue tunic and black pants and looks back over his shoulder at the viewer.]]

His father Charles was a staunch royalist and accomplished artist whose paintings were displayed and given prizes at the [[Salon (Paris)|Parisian salon]], at least in those years when he was not absent in protest of the rise to power of [[Louis Napoleon]]. His paintings often centred around themes related to the [[Roman Catholic]] Church, classicism, and nobility, which reflected those things he thought most important.&lt;ref name=&quot;m1719&quot;&gt;MacAloon, pp 17–19&lt;/ref&gt; In a later semi-fictional autobiographical piece called ''Le Roman d'un rallié'', Coubertin describes his relationship with both his mother and his father as having been somewhat strained during his childhood and adolescence. His memoirs elaborated further, describing as a pivotal moment his disappointment upon meeting [[Henri, Count of Chambord]], whom the elder Coubertin believed to be the rightful king.&lt;ref name=&quot;m24-28&quot;&gt;MacAloon, pp 24–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin grew up in a time of profound change in France: France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the [[Paris Commune]], and the establishment of the [[French Third Republic]], and later the [[Dreyfus Affair]].&lt;ref&gt;MacAloon, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; But while these events were the setting of his childhood, his school experiences were just as formative. In October 1874, his parents enrolled him in a new Jesuit school called ''Externat de la rue de Vienne'', which was still under construction for his first five years there. While many of the school's attendees were day students, Coubertin boarded at the school under the supervision of a Jesuit priest, which his parents hoped would instill him with a strong moral and religious education.&lt;ref name=&quot;m3233&quot;&gt;MacAloon, pp 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; There, he was among the top three students in his class, and was an officer of the school's elite academy made up of its best and brightest. This suggests that despite his rebelliousness at home, Coubertin adapted well to the strict rigors of a Jesuit education.&lt;ref name=&quot;m37&quot;&gt;MacAloon, p 37&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aristocrat, Coubertin had a number of career paths from which to choose, including potentially prominent roles in the military or politics. But he chose instead to pursue a career as an intellectual, studying and later writing on a broad range of topics, including education, history, literature, and sociology.&lt;ref name=&quot;H5&quot;/&gt;

==Educational philosophy==
The subject which he seems to have been most deeply interested in was education, and his study focused in particular on physical education and the role of sport in schooling. In 1883, he visited England for the first time, and studied the program of physical education instituted by [[Thomas Arnold]] at the [[Rugby School]]. Coubertin credited these methods with leading to the expansion of British power during the 19th century and advocated their use in French institutions. The inclusion of physical education in the curriculum of French schools would become an ongoing pursuit and passion of Coubertin's.&lt;ref name=&quot;H5&quot;/&gt;

In fact, Coubertin is thought to have exaggerated the importance of sport to Thomas Arnold, whom he viewed as “one of the founders of athletic chivalry”. The character-reforming influence of sport with which Coubertin was so impressed is more likely to have originated in the novel ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' rather than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself. Nonetheless, Coubertin was an enthusiast in need of a cause and he found it in England and in Thomas Arnold.&lt;ref&gt;Muddied Oafs, The Soul of Rugby, Richard Beard, Yellow Jersey Press, 2004, ISBN 0224063944&lt;/ref&gt; “Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,” wrote Coubertin, “gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education. The cause was quickly won. Playing fields sprang up all over England”.&lt;ref name=&quot;D 4&quot;&gt;''Physical exercises in the modern world''. Lecture given at the Sorbonne, November 1892.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrigued by what he had read about English public schools, in 1883, at the age of twenty, Fredy went to [[Rugby School|Rugby]] and to other English schools to see for himself. He described the results in a book, ''L’Education en Angleterre'', which was published in Paris in 1888. This hero of his book is Thomas Arnold, and on his second visit in 1886, Coubertin reflected on Arnold's influence in the chapel at Rugby School.&lt;ref name=&quot;E 5&quot;&gt;Pierre de Coubertin, ''Une Campagne de 21 Ans 1887–1908'' (Librairie de l’education physique, Paris: 1909)&lt;/ref&gt;

What Coubertin saw on the playing fields of Rugby and the other English schools he visited was how “organised sport can create moral and social strength”.&lt;ref name=&quot;F 6&quot;&gt;Pierre de Coubertin. ''The Olympic Idea''. Discourses and Essays. Editions Internationales Olympiques, Lausanne, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did organised games help to set the mind and body in equilibrium, it also prevented the time being wasted in other ways. First developed by the ancient Greeks, it was an approach to education that he felt the rest of the world had forgotten and to whose revival he was to dedicate the rest of his life.

As a historian and a thinker on education, Coubertin romanticised [[ancient Greece]]. Thus, when he began to develop his theory of physical education, he naturally looked to the example set by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] idea of the [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]], a training facility that simultaneously encouraged physical and intellectual development. He saw in these gymnasia what he called a triple unity between old and young, between disciplines, and between different types of people, meaning between those whose work was theoretical and those whose work was practical. Coubertin advocated for these concepts, this triple unity, to be incorporated into schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

But while Coubertin was certainly a romantic, and while his idealised vision of ancient Greece would lead him later to the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, his advocacy for physical education was based on practical concerns as well. He believed that men who received physical education would be better prepared to fight in wars, and better able to win conflicts like the [[Franco-Prussian War]], in which France had been humiliated. Additionally, he also saw sport as democratic, in that sports competition crossed class lines, although it did so without causing a mingling of classes, which he did not support.&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;/&gt;

Unfortunately for Coubertin, his efforts to incorporate more physical education into French schools failed. The failure of this endeavour, however, was closely followed by the development of a new idea, the revival of the [[ancient Olympic Games]], the creation of a festival of international athleticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;/&gt;

He was particularly fond of rugby and was the referee of the first ever French championship [[rugby union]] final on 20 March [[French Rugby Championship 1892|1892]] between [[Racing Métro 92|Racing Club de France]] and [[Stade Français]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/rugbyandtheolympics/history.html |title=Rugby in the Olympics:History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviving the Olympic Games==
{{main|Olympic Games}}
Some historians describe Coubertin as the instigator of the modern Olympic movement, a man whose vision and political skill led to the revival of the Olympic Games which had been practised in antiquity.&lt;ref name=&quot;H5&quot;/&gt; The ancient Olympic Games were held every four years in the Greek sanctuary of [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], in the [[Elis|Kingdom of Elis]], from 776 BC through either 261 or 393 AD. While there were a number of other ancient games celebrated in Greece during this time period, including the [[Pythian Games|Pythian]], [[Nemean Games|Nemean]], and [[Isthmian Games]], Coubertin idealised the Olympic Games as the ultimate ancient athletic competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Centennial Olympic Park statue.jpg|thumb|left|His statue at the [[Centennial Olympic Park]], [[Atlanta]]]]

Thomas Arnold, the Head Master of Rugby School, was an important influence on Coubertin's thoughts about education, but his meetings with Dr. [[William Penny Brookes]] also influenced his thinking about athletic competition to some extent. A trained physician, Brookes believed that the best way to prevent illness was through physical exercise. In 1850, he had initiated a local athletic competition that he referred to as &quot;[[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games|Meetings of the Olympian Class]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of the Olympic Games by David C. Young, p. 144. Blackwell Publishing. 2004. ISBN 1-4051-1130-5&lt;/ref&gt; at the Gaskell recreation ground at [[Much Wenlock]], Shropshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;H10&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the [[Liverpool Athletic Club]], who began holding their own Olympic Festival in the 1860s, Brookes created a National Olympian Association which aimed to encourage such local competition in cities across Britain. These efforts were largely ignored by the British sporting establishment. Brookes also maintained communication with the government and sporting advocates in Greece, seeking a revival of the Olympic Games internationally under the auspices of the Greek government.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1213&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; There, the philanthropist cousins [[Evangelos Zappas|Evangelos]] and [[Konstantinos Zappas]] had used their wealth to fund Olympics within Greece, and paid for the restoration of the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] that was later used during the [[1896 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H18&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of Brookes to encourage the internationalisation of these games came to naught.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1213&quot;/&gt; However, Dr Brookes did organise a national Olympic Games in London, at Crystal Palace, in 1866 and this was the first Olympics to resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 1996, p. 36&quot;&gt;Young (1996), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; But while others had created Olympic contests within their countries, and broached the idea of international competition, it was Coubertin whose work would lead to the establishment of the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the organisation of the first modern Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;H18&quot;/&gt;

In 1888, Coubertin founded the Comité pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques more well known as the Comité Jules Simon. Coubertin's earliest reference to the modern notion of Olympic Games criticises the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for reviving the Olympic Games as an international competition came to Coubertin in 1889, apparently independently of Brookes, and he spent the following five years organising an international meeting of athletes and sports enthusiasts that might make it happen.&lt;ref name=&quot;H6&quot;/&gt; Dr Brookes had organised a national Olympic Games that was held at Crystal Palace in London in 1866.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young 1996, p. 36&quot;/&gt; In response to a newspaper appeal, Brookes wrote to Coubertin in 1890, and the two began an exchange of letters on education and sport. That October, Brookes hosted the Frenchman at a special festival held in his honour at Much Wenlock. Although he was too old to attend the 1894 Congress, Brookes would continue to support Coubertin's efforts, most importantly by using his connections with the Greek government to seek its support in the endeavour. While Brookes' contribution to the revival of the Olympic Games was recognised in Britain at the time, Coubertin in his later writings largely neglected to mention the role the Englishman played in their development.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1315&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; He did mention the roles of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, but drew a distinction between their founding of athletic Olympics and his own role in the creation of an international contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;H18&quot;/&gt; However, Coubertin together with A. Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to utilise part of Konstantinos' legacy to fund the 1896 Athens Olympic Games separately and in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas that Konstantinos had been executor of.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memoire sure le conflit entre la Grece et la Roumanie concernant l'affaire Zappa – Athens 1893, by F. Martens&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L'affaire Zappa – Paris 1894, by G. Streit&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[George Averoff]] was invited by the Greek government to fund the second refurbishment of the [[Panathinaiko Stadium]] that had already been fully funded by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin's advocacy for the Games centred on a number of ideals about sport. He believed that the early ancient Olympics encouraged competition among amateur rather than professional athletes, and saw value in that. The ancient practice of a sacred truce in association with the Games might have modern implications, giving the Olympics a role in promoting peace. This role was reinforced in Coubertin's mind by the tendency of athletic competition to promote understanding across cultures, thereby lessening the dangers of war. In addition, he saw the Games as important in advocating his philosophical ideal for athletic competition: that the competition itself, the struggle to overcome one's opponent, was more important than winning.&lt;ref name=&quot;H78&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Coubertin expressed this ideal thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''L'important dans la vie ce n'est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l'essentiel ce n'est pas d'avoir vaincu mais de s'être bien battu.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Coubertin prepared for his Congress, he continued to develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games. While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex. By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticised the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its specific exclusion of working-class athletes was wrong. While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was in order for the time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money. Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.&lt;ref name=&quot;H8&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the development of an Olympic philosophy, Coubertin invested time in the creation and development of a national association to coordinate athletics in France, the [[Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques]] (USFSA). In 1889, French athletics associations had grouped together for the first time and Coubertin founded a monthly magazine ''La Revue Athletique'', the first French periodical devoted exclusively to athletics&lt;ref name=&quot;RanOnt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randonneursontario.ca/history/giff.html |title=Randonneurs Ontario, Profile of Pierre Giffard |publisher=Randonneursontario.ca |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modelled on ''The Athlete'', an English journal established around 1862.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fechain AC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.nordnet.fr/~scharlet/histoire.htm |title=Féchain Athlétique Club, Association loi 1901-Affiliation à la Fédération Française d’athlétisme, Histoire |publisher=Home.nordnet.fr |date=31 December 1982 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed by seven sporting societies with approximately 800 members, by 1892 the association had expanded to 62 societies with 7,000 members.&lt;ref name=&quot;H14&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

That November, at the annual meeting of the USFSA, Coubertin first publicly suggested the idea of reviving the Olympics. His speech met general applause, but little commitment to the Olympic ideal he was advocating for, perhaps because sporting associations and their members tended to focus on their own area of expertise and had little identity as sportspeople in a general sense. This disappointing result was prelude to a number of challenges he would face in organising his international conference. In order to develop support for the conference, he began to play down its role in reviving Olympic Games and instead promoted it as a conference on amateurism in sport which, he thought, was slowly being eroded by betting and sponsorships. This led to later suggestions that participants were convinced to attend under false pretenses. Little interest was expressed by those he spoke to during trips to the United States in 1893 and London in 1894, and an attempt to involve the Germans angered French gymnasts who did not want the Germans invited at all. Despite these challenges, the USFSA continued its planning for the games, adopting in its first program for the meeting eight articles to address, only one of which had to do with the Olympics. A later program would give the Olympics a much more prominent role in the meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;H1820&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The congress was held on 23 June 1894 at the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris. Once there, participants divided the congress into two commissions, one on amateurism and the other on reviving the Olympics. A Greek participant, [[Demetrius Vikelas]], was appointed to head the commission on the Olympics, and would later become the first President of the International Olympic Committee. Along with Coubertin, C. Herbert of Britain's [[Amateur Athletic Association]] and W.M. Sloane of the United States helped lead the efforts of the commission. In its report, the commission proposed that Olympic Games be held every four years and that the program for the Games be one of modern rather than ancient sports. They also set the date and location for the first modern Olympic Games, the [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in Athens, Greece, and the second, the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris. Coubertin had originally opposed the choice of Greece, as he had concerns about the ability of a weakened Greek state to host the competition, but was convinced by Vikelas to support the idea. The commission's proposals were accepted unanimously by the congress, and the modern Olympic movement was officially born. The proposals of the other commission, on amateurism, were more contentious, but this commission also set important precedents for the Olympic Games, specifically the use of heats to narrow participants and the banning of prize money in most contests.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2022&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 20–22&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Congress, the institutions created there began to be formalised into the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Demetrius Vikelas as its first President. The work of the IOC increasingly focused on the planning the 1896 Athens Games, and de Coubertin played a background role as Greek authorities took the lead in logistical organisation of the Games in Greece itself, offering technical advice such as a sketch of a design of a [[velodrome]] to be used in cycling competitions. He also took the lead in planning the program of events, although to his disappointment neither [[polo]], [[Association football|football]], or [[boxing]] were included in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2326&quot;&gt;Hill, pp.23–26&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek organising committee had been informed that four foreign football teams were to participate however not one foreign football team showed up and despite Greek preparations for a football tournament it was cancelled during the Games.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek authorities were frustrated that he could not provide an exact estimate of the number of attendees more than a year in advance. In France, Coubertin's efforts to elicit interest in the Games among athletes and the press met difficulty, largely because the participation of German athletes angered French nationalists who begrudged Germany their victory in the Franco-Prussian War. Germany also threatened not to participate after rumours spread that Coubertin had sworn to keep Germany out, but following a letter to the [[Kaiser]] denying the accusation, the German National Olympic Committee decided to attend. Coubertin himself was frustrated by the Greeks, who increasingly ignored him in their planning and who wanted to continue to hold the Games in Athens every four years, against de Coubertin's wishes. The conflict was resolved after he suggested to the King of Greece that he hold pan-Hellenic games in between Olympiads, an idea which the King accepted, although Coubertin would receive some angry correspondence even after the compromise was reached and the King did not mention him at all during the banquet held in honour of foreign athletes during the 1896 Games.&lt;ref name=&quot;H2528&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Coubertin took over the IOC presidency when Demetrius Vikelas stepped down after the Olympics in his own country. Despite the initial success, the Olympic Movement faced hard times, as the 1900 (in De Coubertin's own Paris) and 1904 Games were both swallowed by World's Fairs, and received little attention. The Paris Games were not organised by Coubertin or the IOC nor were they called Olympics at that time. The St. Louis Games was hardly internationalised and was an embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;Young (1996), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

===President of the International Olympic Committee===
The [[Intercalated Games|1906 Summer Olympics]] revived the momentum, and the Olympic Games have come to be regarded as the world’s foremost sports competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Overview of Olympic Games | author= | coauthors= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428005/Olympic-Games | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica | accessdate=4 June 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coubertin created the modern pentathlon for the 1912 Olympics, and subsequently stepped down from his IOC presidency after the 1924 Olympics in Paris, which proved much more successful than the first attempt in that city in 1900. He was succeeded as president, in 1925, by Belgian [[Henri de Baillet-Latour]].

Coubertin remained Honorary President of the IOC until he died in 1937 in Geneva, Switzerland. He was buried in Lausanne (the seat of the IOC), although, in accordance with his will, his heart was buried separately in a monument near the ruins of ancient Olympia.

Coubertin won the [[Art competitions at the 1912 Summer Olympics|gold medal for literature]] at the 1912 Summer Olympics for his poem ''Ode to Sport''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Gjerde|first = Arild|coauthors = Jeroen Heijmans, Bill Mallon, and Hilary Evans|title = Pierre, Baron de Coubertin Biography and Olympic Results|work = Olympics|publisher = Sports Reference.com|year = 2011|url = http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/de/pierre-baron-de-coubertin-1.html|accessdate =7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scouting==
In 1911, Pierre de Coubertin founded the inter-religious Scouting organisation ''Eclaireurs Français'' (EF) in France, which later merged to form the [[Eclaireuses et Eclaireurs de France]].

==Later life==
Pierre was the last person to the family name. In the words of his biographer John MacAloon, &quot;The last of his lineage, Pierre de Coubertin was the only member of it whose fame would outlive him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacAloon, p 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Image:Picswiss VD-46-57.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue at [[Lausanne]]]]
Coubertin's legacy has been criticised by a number of scholars. David C. Young, a scholar of antiquity who has studied the ancient Olympic Games, believes that Coubertin misunderstood the ancient Games and therefore based his justification for the creation of the modern Games on false grounds. Specifically, Young points to Coubertin's assertion that ancient Olympic athletes were amateurs as incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;H67&quot;&gt;Hill, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; This question of the professionalism of ancient Olympic athletes is a subject of debate amongst scholars, with Young and others arguing that the athletes were professional throughout the history of the ancient Games, while other scholars led by Pleket argue that the earliest Olympic athletes were in fact amateur, and that the Games only became professionalised after about 480 BCE. Coubertin agreed with this latter view, and saw this professionalisation as undercutting the morality of the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;H7&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Young asserts that the effort to limit international competition to amateur athletes, which Coubertin was a part of, was in fact part of efforts to give the upper classes greater control over athletic competition, removing such control from the working classes. Coubertin may have played a role in such a movement, but his defenders argue that he did so unconscious of any class repercussions.&lt;ref name=&quot;H7&quot;/&gt;

However, it is clear that his romanticised vision of the Olympic Games was fundamentally different from that described in the historical record. For example, de Coubertin's idea that participation is more important than winning (&quot;L'important c'est de participer&quot;) is at odds with the ideals of the Greeks. The [[Apostle Paul]], writing in the first century to [[Christians]] in the city of [[Corinth]] where the [[Isthmian Games]] were held, reflects this in his writings when he says, &quot;Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize&quot;, (1 Corinthians 9:24).

Coubertin's assertion that the Games were the impetus for peace was also an exaggeration; the peace which he spoke of only existed to allow athletes to travel safely to Olympia, and neither prevented the outbreak of wars nor ended ongoing ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;H78&quot;/&gt;

Scholars have critiqued the idea that athletic competition might lead to greater understanding between cultures and, therefore, to peace. Christopher Hill claims that modern participants in the Olympic movement may defend this particular belief, &quot;in a spirit similar to that in which the Church of England remains attached to the [[Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion]], which a Priest in that Church must sign.&quot; In other words, that they may not wholly believe it but hold to it for historical reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;H8&quot;/&gt;

Questions have also been raised about the veracity of Coubertin's account of his role in the planning of the 1896 Athens Games. According to Young, either due to personal or professional distractions, Coubertin played little role in planning, despite entreaties by Vikelas. Young also suggests that the story about Coubertin's having sketched the velodrome were untrue, and that he had in fact given an interview in which he suggested he did not want Germans to participate, something he later denied in a letter to the Kaiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;H28&quot;&gt;Hill, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

The [[Olympic_symbols#Motto|Olympic motto]] ''[[Citius, Altius, Fortius]]'' (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was proposed by Coubertin in 1894 and has been official since 1924.  The motto was coined by [[Henri Didon]] OP, a friend of Coubertin, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.johannes-hospiz.de/cms/Begleitung/Denkanstoesse/Meditation/index-b-1-65-244.html German source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=motto&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Ceremony|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reports/EN/en_report_268.pdf|publisher=International Olympics Committee|accessdate=23 August 2012|page=3|format=pdf|year=2002}}; &quot;Sport athlétique&quot;, 14 mars 1891: &quot;[...] dans une éloquente allocution il a souhaité que ce drapeau les conduise ‘souvent à la victoire, à la lutte toujours’. Il a dit qu’il leur donnait pour devise ces trois mots qui sont le fondement et la raison d’être des sports athlétiques: citius, altius, fortius, ‘plus vite, plus haut, plus fort’.&quot;, cited in Hoffmane, Simone ''La carrière du père Didon, Dominicain. 1840 - 1900'', Doctoral thesis, Université de Paris IV - Sorbonne, 1985, p. 926; cf. Michaela Lochmann, ''Les fondements pédagogiques de la devise olympique „citius, altius, fortius“''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pierre de Coubertin medal]] (also known as the Coubertin medal or the True Spirit of Sportsmanship medal) is an award given by the [[International Olympic Committee]] to those [[Sportsperson|athletes]] that demonstrate the spirit of [[sportsmanship]] in the Olympic Games. This medal is considered by many athletes and spectators to be the highest award that an Olympic athlete can receive, even greater than a gold medal. The International Olympic Committee considers it as its highest honour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

A [[minor planet]] [[2190 Coubertin]] discovered in 1976 by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astronomer [[Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh]] is named in his honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schmadel&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Schmadel | first = Lutz D. | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Minor Planet Names | page = 178 | edition = 5th  | year = 2003 | publisher=Springer Verlag | location = New York | url = http://books.google.com/books?q=2190+Coubertin+GV3 | isbn = 3-540-00238-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street where the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in Montreal is located (which hosted the [[1976 Summer Olympic Games]]) was named after Pierre de Coubertin, giving the stadium the address 4549 Pierre de Coubertin Avenue. It is the only Olympic Stadium in the world that lies on a street named after Coubertin. There are also two schools in Montreal named after Pierre de Coubertin.

He was portrayed by [[Louis Jourdan]] in the 1984 [[NBC]] miniseries, [[The First Olympics: Athens 1896]].

      <text xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[{{Operator notation|logo=[[File:Prefix-dia.svg|125px]]}}
'''Polish notation''', also known as '''Polish prefix notation''' or simply '''prefix notation''', is a form of notation for [[logic]], [[arithmetic]], and [[algebra]]. Its distinguishing feature is that it places [[Operator (mathematics)|operator]]s to the left of their [[operand]]s. If the [[arity]] of the operators is fixed, the result is a syntax lacking parentheses or other brackets that can still be parsed without ambiguity. The [[Poland|Polish]] logician [[Jan Łukasiewicz]] invented this notation in 1924 in order to simplify [[Propositional calculus|sentential logic]].

The term ''Polish notation'' is sometimes taken (as the opposite of ''[[infix notation]]'') to also include Polish ''postfix'' notation, or [[Reverse Polish notation]], in which the operator is placed ''after'' the operands.&lt;ref&gt;

When Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]] of programming languages, it is readily parsed into [[abstract syntax tree]]s and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same.  Because of this, [[Lisp_(programming_language)|Lisp]] ([[#Computer programming|see below]]) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in terms of prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).

Here is a quotation from a paper by [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on &quot;Generalizing Deduction&quot;'', page 180.&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924.  I used that notation for the first time in my article  Łukasiewicz(1), p. 610, footnote.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reference cited by Jan Łukasiewicz above is apparently a lithographed report in [[Polish language|Polish]]. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz ''Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on &quot;Generalizing Deduction&quot;'' was reviewed by [[Henry Pogorzelski|H. A. Pogorzelski]] in the ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Pogorzelski, H. A., [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2269644 &quot;Reviewed work(s): Remarks on Nicod's Axiom and on &quot;Generalizing Deduction&quot; by Jan Łukasiewicz; Jerzy Słupecki; Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe&quot;], ''The Journal of Symbolic Logic'', Vol. 30, No. 3 (Sep. 1965), pp. 376–377. The original paper by Jan Łukasiewicz was published in Warsaw in 1961 in a volume edited by Jerzy Słupecki.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alonzo Church]] mentions this notation in his classic book on [[mathematical logic]] as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] and [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]]'s logical notational exposition and work in [[Principia Mathematica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Alonzo|last=Church|title=Introduction to Mathematical Logic|location=Princeton, New Jersey|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1944}} – p. 38: &quot;Worthy of remark is the parenthesis-free notation of Jan Łukasiewicz. In this the letters N, A, C, E, K are used in the roles of negation, disjunction, implication, equivalence, conjunction respectively. ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Łukasiewicz 1951 book, ''Aristotle’s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the [[function symbol|functors]] before the [[argument of a function|arguments]] to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Łukasiewicz, (1951) ''Aristotle’s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic'', Chapter IV &quot;Aristotle's System in Symbolic Form&quot; (section on &quot;org.wikapidia.sr.Explanation of the Symbolism&quot;), p. 78 and on.&lt;/ref&gt; He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with [[Alfred Tarski]] on the [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;Łukasiewicz, Jan; Tarski, Alfred, &quot;Untersuchungen über den Aussagenkalkül&quot; [&quot;Investigations into
the sentential calculus&quot;], ''Comptes Rendus des séances de la Société des Sciences et des Lettres de Varsovie'', Vol, 23 (1930) Cl. III, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

While no longer used much in logic,{{citation_needed|date=August 2012}} Polish notation has since found a place in [[computer science]].

==Arithmetic==
The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is, in prefix notation, written &quot;+ 1 2&quot; rather than &quot;1 + 2&quot;.  In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be nontrivial expressions including operators of their own. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as
: (5 − 6) * 7
can be written in prefix as
: * (− 5 6) 7
Since the simple arithmetic operators are all [[binary function|binary]] (at least, in arithmetic contexts), any prefix representation thereof is unambiguous, and bracketing the prefix expression is unnecessary. As such, the previous expression can be further simplified to
: * − 5 6 7

The processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with ''any'' notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in prefix notation this &quot;innermost-ness&quot; can be conveyed by order rather than bracketing.

In the classical notation, the parentheses in the infix version were required, since moving them
: 5 − (6 * 7)
or simply removing them
: 5 − 6 * 7
would change the meaning and result of the overall expression, due to the [[Order of operations|precedence rule]].

Similarly
: 5 − (6 * 7)
can be written in Polish notation as
: − 5 * 6 7

==Computer programming==
Prefix notation has seen wide application in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] [[s-expressions]], where the brackets are required since the operators in the language are themselves data ([[first-class function]]s).  Lisp functions may also have variable [[arity]].  The [https://code.google.com/p/ambi/ Ambi] programming language uses Polish Notation for arithmetic operations and program construction. The postfix [[reverse Polish notation]] is used in many [[Stack-oriented programming language|stack-based programming language]]s like [[PostScript]] and [[FORTH|Forth]], and is the operating principle of certain [[calculator]]s, notably from [[HP calculators|Hewlett-Packard]].

The number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.

==Order of operations==
Order of operations is defined within the structure of prefix notation and can be easily determined.  One thing to keep in mind is that when executing an operation, the operation is applied ''to'' the first operand ''by'' the second operand.  This is not an issue with operations that commute, but for non-commutative operations like division or subtraction, this fact is crucial to the analysis of a statement.  For example, the following statement:

  / 10 5 = 2

is read as &quot;divide 10 by 5&quot;.  Thus the solution is 2, not 1/2 as would be the result of an incorrect analysis.

Prefix notation is especially popular with [[Stack-oriented programming language|stack-based]] operations due to its innate ability to easily distinguish order of operations without the need for parentheses.  To evaluate order of operations under prefix notation, one does not even need to memorize an operational hierarchy, as with [[infix notation]].  Instead, one looks directly to the notation to discover which operator to evaluate first.  Reading an expression from left to right, one first looks for an operator and proceeds to look for two operands.  If another operator is found before two operands are found, then the old operator is placed aside until this new operator is resolved.  This process iterates until an operator is resolved, which must happen eventually, as there must be one more operand than there are operators in a complete statement.  Once resolved, the operator and the two operands are replaced with a new operand.  Because one operator and two operands are removed and one operand is added, there is a net loss of one operator and one operand, which still leaves an expression with ''N'' operators and ''N''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 operands, thus allowing the iterative process to continue.  This is the general theory behind using stacks in programming languages to evaluate a statement in prefix notation, although there are various algorithms that manipulate the process.  Once analyzed, a statement in prefix notation becomes less intimidating to the human mind as it allows some separation from convention with added convenience.  An example shows the ease with which a complex statement in prefix notation can be deciphered through order of operations:

  − * / 15 − 7 '''+ 1 1''' 3 + 2 + 1 1 =
  − * / 15 '''− 7   2'''   3 + 2 + 1 1 =
  − * '''/ 15     5'''     3 + 2 + 1 1 =
  − '''*        3       3''' + 2 + 1 1 =
  −          9         + 2 '''+ 1 1''' =
  −          9         '''+ 2   2'''   =
  '''−          9         4'''         =
                 '''5'''
An equivalent in-fix is as follows:
((15 / (7 − (1 + 1))) * 3) − (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5

Here is an implementation (in pseudocode) of prefix evaluation using a stack. Note that under this implementation the input string is scanned from right to left. This differs from the algorithm described above in which the string is processed from left to right. Both algorithms compute the same value for all valid strings.
 Scan the given prefix expression from right to left
 for each symbol
  {
   if operand then
     push onto stack
   if operator then
    {
     operand1=pop stack
     operand2=pop stack
     compute operand1 operator operand2
     push result onto stack
    }
  }
 return top of stack as result

== Example ==

This uses the same expression as before and the algorithm above.

|}

The result is at the top of the stack.

[[Image:Czciesz podstawowka 565.jpg|thumb|230px|A primary school in [[Český Těšín]], [[Czech Republic]].]]

A '''primary school''' (from French ''école primaire''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=primary Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) is an institution in which children receive the first stage of [[compulsory education]] known as [[Primary education|primary or elementary education]]. It can be divided into public and private. 

Primary school is the preferred term in the United Kingdom and many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Nations]], and in most publications of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]).&lt;ref&gt;Primary school. In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved on 12 June 2007, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9061377&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, and especially in North America, the term '''[[elementary school]]''' is preferred. Children generally attend primary school from around the age of four or five until the age of eleven or twelve. In some places, primary schooling has historically further been divided between '''lower primary schools''' ('''LP schools''') and '''Higher primary schools''' ('''HP schools''').&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Ryburn Payne, ''Public Elementary School Curricula: A Comparative Study of Representative Cities of the United States, England, Germany and France'' (1905), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
{{main|Education in Australia}}
In Australia, Primary School is generally for children aged 5–12. In South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland grade 7 is part of primary school; in other states it forms part of secondary education. In certain year groups, students in all schools take part in the National Assessment Programme (NAP).&lt;ref name=&quot;NAP&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.det.act.gov.au/teaching_and_learning/assessment_and_reporting/national_assessment_program_nap|title=National Assessment Program (NAP)|accessdate=28 July 2008|publisher=ACT Department of Education and Training|work=ACT DET website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year levels:

==Canada==
{{main|Education in Canada}}
In Canada, primary school (also known as elementary school) usually begins at the ages of four through six, starting with either Kindergarten or Grade 1 and lasts until age 13 or 14. Many places in Canada split primary school into two divisions, with primary (or elementary) lasting from Kindergarten to grades five or six (ages 10–11), and junior secondary or middle school lasting from grades six or seven to grades eight or nine (ages 13–15).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In Nova Scotia &quot;elementary school&quot; is the most common term. The provincial government of Nova Scotia uses the term &quot;Primary&quot; instead of Kindergarten.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.relocatetonovascotia.com/what-to-expect/education/&lt;/ref&gt;

==France==

In France, primary schools provide education from the age of 6 to 11.
The students start in CP (cours préparatoire) then past in CE1, CE2 (cours élémentaires), CM1 and finally CM2 (cours moyens).

==Germany==
Depending on the [[States of Germany|federal state]], primary schools provide education from Class 1 to Class 4 or from Class 1 to Class 6. After primary school students may attend a [[Hauptschule]], [[Mittelschule]], [[Regionale Schule]] or a [[Realschule]], which are more vocationally orientated, a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], which is more academically oriented, or a [[Gesamtschule]], which is comparable to a [[Comprehensive School]].

==Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, students attend primary schools for the first six years of compulsory education.

==Ireland==
{{main|Education in the Republic of Ireland}}
In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], children aged between 4–6 years begin attending primary school. There are eight different '[[educational stages|grades]]'. Participation is compulsory. This is the first of 14 prescribed years of formal [[education]] from a standardised [[curriculum]] set by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Singapore==
{{main|Education in Singapore}}
The medium of instruction is English. After completing kindergarten, or pre-school years, children will then have to go through 6 years compulsory of primary education, from ages 7 to 12. At the end of primary education, students are required to take a standardised national exam, the Primary School Leaving Examination(also known as PSLE). Based on PSLE results, students apply and are sorted into secondary schools for a 4 or 5 year course.

==Somalia==
In [[Somalia]], pupils start primary school when they are 7 and finish it at the age of 11 starting from form 1 to form 4. Pupils must firstly have attended casual school known as ''dugsi'' and learnt the Muslim holy book [[Quran|Qur'an]], and the meaning of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] language. Pupils who had not done this are not permitted to start primary school as they will be examined before starting. Pupils' age may sometimes vary seeing that some pupils achieve higher than their predicted grade and may skip the year while some require to repeat the year if they had not achieved the grade required from them. After finishing primary, students move to intermediate school.

==Sweden==
::''Main article: [[Education in Sweden]].''
In Sweden kids go to the primary school (''grundskola'') through the ages of 7 and 15. After that they can choose to (although it is pretty uncommon not to) study at a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] for three years where they pick a program devoted to a particular direction (i.e. [[Science]], [[Aesthetics]], [[Civics]]). During the gymnasium all students have some subjects they have to study, but not during all three years. Almost all children attend a preparatory year at the age of 6. This initial year is not mandatory.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The children don't start receiving grades until their eighth year. This is, however, about to change according to a new proposal from the [[Swedish government]], where grades will be given from the sixth year.&lt;ref name=&quot;SW_SCHOOL&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/10086/a/97432|title=More levels in new grading scale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
{{See also|Education in the United Kingdom}}

In the UK schools providing primary education in the [[state school|state]] sector are known as primary schools. They generally cater for children aged from four to eleven ([[Reception (school)|Reception]] to [[Year Six]]; in Scotland Primary One to Primary Seven). 

In areas that adopted a three-tier system, the term primary school is often used as an alternative to [[First School]], taking in ages up to 9 or 10 years old, although for education planning purposes, the term &quot;primary education&quot; in these areas will still cover the age groups as in a two-tier system.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In the private sector, fee-paying schools which provide primary education are known as [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory schools]], and they often cater for children up to the age of thirteen. As their name suggests, preparatory schools are designed to prepare pupils for entrance examinations for fee-paying [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==United States==
{{main|Education in the United States}}

In the United States, the term primary school is used in a general way to describe a school housing the primary grades, usually meaning [[kindergarten]] (ages five to six) or [[first grade]] (ages 6 and 7) to [[fourth grade]] (ages 9 to 10), [[fifth grade|fifth]] (ages 10 to 11), or [[sixth grade]] (ages 11 to 12), though this is more commonly referred to as an [[elementary school]]. Very few schools in the US actually use the term primary school as part of their school name and such schools are generally [[private school]]s, serving very young children.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

'''Piedmont''' ({{lang-it|Piemonte}}, {{IPA-it|pjeˈmonte|pron}}; [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]] and {{lang-oc|Piemont}}; {{lang-fr|link=no|Piémont}}) is one of the 20 [[regions of Italy]]. It has an area of 25,402&amp;nbsp;square kilometres (9,808 sq mi) and a population of about 4.4 million. The capital of Piedmont is [[Turin]]. The main local language is [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]]. [[Occitan language|Occitan]] is also spoken by a minority in the [[Occitan Valleys]] situated in the Provinces of [[Cuneo]] and [[Turin]]. [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] is also spoken by another minority in the alpine heights of the [[Province of Turin]]. The name Piedmont comes from medieval Latin Pedemontium or Pedemontis, i.e., ''ad pedem montium'', meaning “at the foot of the mountains” (attested in documents of the end of the 13th century).&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.it/books?id=KjttelynsZEC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=QN_EIDTnjb&amp;dq=nome%20piemonte&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=nome%20piemonte&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Piedmont}}

[[File:Castelnuovo Calcea from San Marzano Oliveto.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Montferrat]] landscape, with the distant [[Alps]] in the background.]]

Piedmont is surrounded on three sides by the [[Alps]], including [[Monte Viso|Monviso]], where the [[Po River|Po]] rises, and [[Monte Rosa]]. It borders with France, Switzerland and the Italian regions of [[Lombardy]], [[Liguria]], [[Aosta Valley]] and for a very small fragment with [[Emilia Romagna]].
The geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).
Piedmont is the second largest of [[Italy]]'s 20 regions, after [[Sicily]]. It is broadly contiguous with the upper part of the drainage basin of the river [[Po River|Po]], which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and it's Italy’s largest river. The Po collects all the waters provided within the semicircle of mountains ([[Alps]] and [[Apennines]]) which surround the region on three sides.
From the highest peaks the land slopes down to hilly areas, (not always, though; sometimes there is a brusque transition from the mountains to the plains) and then to the upper, and then the lower the great [[Padan Plain]]. The boundary between the first and the second is characterised by risorgive springs, typical of the Padan Plain which supply fresh water both to the rivers and to a dense network of irrigation canals.
The countryside is very varied: one passes from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and of Gran Paradiso, to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the [[Langhe]] and of [[Montferrat]] to the plains.
The percentage of the territory which is a [[protected area]] is 7.6%. There are 56 different national or regional parks. One such park is the [[Gran Paradiso National Park]].

== History ==
{{see also|Kingdom of Sardinia}}
[[File:Stupinigi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi]], in [[Nichelino]], is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites|World Heritage Site]].]]

Piedmont was inhabited in early historic times by [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes such as the [[Taurini]] and the [[Salassi]]. They were later submitted by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] (c. 220 BC), who founded several colonies there including ''Augusta Taurinorum ''(Turin) and ''Eporedia'' ([[Ivrea]]). After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the region was repeatedly invaded by the [[Burgundians]], the [[Goths]] (5th century), [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Lombards]] (6th century), [[Franks]] (773). In the 9th–10th centuries there were further incursions by the [[Magyars]] and [[Saracens]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} At the time Piedmont, as part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was subdivided into several marks and counties.

[[File:SardiniePiemont.jpg|thumb|right|Kingdom of [[Sardinia]] in 1856.]]

In 1046, [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Oddo of Savoy]] added Piedmont to their main territory of [[Savoy]], with a capital at [[Chambéry]] (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (municipalities) of [[Asti]] and [[Alessandria]] and the marquisates of [[Marquisate of Saluzzo|Saluzzo]] and [[Marquisate of Montferrat|Montferrat]]. The County of Savoy was elevated to a duchy in 1416, and Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert|Emanuele Filiberto]] moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], founding what evolved into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and increasing Turin's importance as a European capital.

The [[Republic of Alba]] was created in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in Piedmont before the area was annexed by France in 1801. In June 1802 a new client republic, the [[Subalpine Republic]], was established in Piedmont and in September it was also annexed. In the [[congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored, and furthermore received the [[Republic of Genoa]] to strengthen it as a barrier against France.

Piedmont was an initial springboard for [[Italian unification|Italy's unification]] in 1859–1861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1820–1821{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} and 1848–1849. This process is sometimes referred to as ''Piedmontisation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Collier |first= Martin |year= 2003 |title= Italian Unification, 1820–71 |location= Oxford |publisher= Heinemann |page= [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YG9kZBJdKJwC&amp;pg=PA75 75]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the efforts were later contradicted by efforts of rural farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Valeria Fargion, [http://www.cevipof.msh-paris.fr/rencontres/colloq/palier/Full%20paper/Fargion%20Valeria%20FP.doc From the Southern to the Northern Question: Territorial and Social Politics in Italy], paper presented at the RC 19 conference 'Welfare state restructuring: processes and social outcomes', 2–4 September 2004, Sciences-Po Paris.

Retrieved 7 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Savoy became [[Kings of Italy]], and Turin briefly became the capital of Italy. However, the addition of territory paradoxically reduced Piedmont's importance to the kingdom, and the capital was moved to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and then to Rome. One remaining recognition of Piedmont's historical role was that the [[crown prince]] of Italy was known as the [[Prince of Piedmont]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Piemonterisaie.jpg|thumb|left|Rice fields between [[Novara]] and [[Vercelli]]]]

Lowland Piedmont is a fertile agricultural region. The main agricultural products in Piedmont are cereals, including rice, representing more than 10% of national production, maize, grapes for wine-making, fruit and milk.&lt;ref name=&quot;europa1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more than 800,000 head of cattle in 2000, livestock production accounts for half of final agricultural production in Piedmont. Piedmont is one of the great winegrowing regions in Italy. More than half of its {{convert|700|km2|acre}} of vineyards are registered with [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] designations. It produces prestigious wines as [[Barolo]], [[Barbaresco]], from the [[Langhe]] near [[Alba (CN)|Alba]], and the [[Moscato d'Asti]] as well as the sparkling [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from the vineyards around [[Asti]]. Indigenous grape varieties include [[Nebbiolo]], [[Barbera]], [[Dolcetto]], [[Freisa]], [[Grignolino]] and [[Brachetto]].

The region contains major industrial centres, the main of which is [[Turin]], home to the [[FIAT]] automobile works. [[Olivetti]], once  a major electronics industry whose plant was in [[Scarmagno]], near [[Ivrea]], has now turned into a small-scale computer service company. [[Biella]] produces tissues and silks. The city of [[Asti]] is located about 55 kilometres (34 miles) east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and it's one of the most important centers of [[Montferrat]], one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5001/ Wine Grape landscapes: Langhe, Roero, Monferrato and Valtellina], Unesco&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alba (CN)|Alba]] is the home of [[Ferrero SpA|Ferrero]]'s chocolate factories and some mechanical industries. There are links with neighbouring France via the [[Fréjus Road Tunnel|Fréjus]] and the [[Colle di Tenda]] tunnels as well as the Montgenèvre Pass. Piedmont also connects with [[Switzerland]] with the [[Simplon Pass|Simplón]] and [[Great St Bernard]] passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses Oriental Piedmont starting from [[Arona (NO)|Arona]] and ending in [[Locarno]], on the border with Italy. The region's airport, [[Turin International Airport|Turin-Caselle]], caters domestic and international flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;europa1&quot;/&gt;
The region has the longest motorway network amongst the Italian regions (about 800&amp;nbsp;km). It radiates from [[Turin]], connecting it with the other provinces in the region, as well as with the other regions in Italy. In 2001, the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants was 623 (above the national average of 575).&lt;ref name=&quot;europa1&quot;/&gt;

Tourism in Piedmont employs 75,534 people and currently comprises 17,367 companies operating in the hospitality and catering sector, with 1,473 hotels and tourist accommodations. The sector generates a turnover of €2,671 million Euros, 3.3% of the €80,196 million which represents the total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region enjoys almost the same level of popularity among Italians and visitors from oversea. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals. International visitors to Piedmont in 2002 accounted for 42% of the total number of tourists with 1,124,696 arrivals. The traditional leading areas for tourism in Piedmont are the Lake District – &quot;Piedmont's riviera&quot;, which accounts for 32.84% of total overnight stays, and the metropolitan area of Turin which accounts for 26.51%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/02_piemontur_en.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 Turin hosted the [[XX Olympic Winter Games]] and in 2007 it hosted the [[2007 Winter Universiade|XXIII Universiade]]. Alpine tourism tends to concentrate in a few highly developed stations like [[Alagna Valsesia]] and [[Sestriere]]. Around 1980, the long-distance trail [[Grande Traversata delle Alpi]] (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the manyfold of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys.

Since 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that highlighted the rich agricultural and [[viticulture|viticultural]] value of the Po valley and northern Italy. In the same year, [[Piemonte Agency for Investments, Export and Tourism]] was founded in order to strengthen the international role of the area and its potential. It was the first Italian institution bringing together all activities carried out by pre-existing local organizations operating for the internationalization of the territory.

The economy of Piedmont is anchored on a rich history of state support for excellence in higher education, including some of the leading universities in Italy.  The Piedmont valley is home to the famous [[University of Turin]], the [[Polytechnic University of Turin]], the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] and, more recently the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{UNICRI|url=http://www.unicri.it/advanced_education/post-graduate_education/llm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population density in Piemonte is lower than the national average. In 2008 it was equal to 174 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, compared to a national figure of about 200. It rises however to 335 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; when just the province of Turin is considered, whereas Verbano-Cusio-Ossola is the less densely populated province (72 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
The population of Piedmont followed a downward trend throughout the 1980s. This drop is the result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of an excess of new immigration over a stable figure for emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The population as a whole has remained stable in the 1990s, although this is the result of a negative natural balance and a positive net migration.

The Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from [[Southern Italy]], and today it has a population of approximately two million. As of 2008, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants live in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population.

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Piedmont}}

In the [[Italian general election, 2008|April 2008 Italian national election]], the population of Piedmont gave 46.8% of its votes to the centre-right coalition led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]].

The Regional Government (''Giunta Regionale'') is presided by the President of the Region (''Presidente della Regione''), who is elected for a five-year term and is composed by the President and the Ministers, who are currently 14, including a Vice President (''Vice Presidente'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.piemonte.it/governo/assessorati/index.htm |title=Sito Ufficiale della Regione Piemonte: Giunta regionale |publisher=Regione.piemonte.it |accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the last regional election, which took place on 29–30 March 2010, [[Roberto Cota]] ([[Lega Nord]]) defeated incumbent [[Mercedes Bresso]] ([[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]).

== Administrative divisions ==
Piedmont is divided into eight provinces:

==Sport==
The sport in Piedmont, except for football, developed itself to a certain level only after the Second World War. Piedmontese teams have a rich tradition of sporting excellence and each of the provinces have a number of established clubs in various sports. In football, notable clubs include [[Juventus]] and [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] (both based in [[Turin]]), the two largest football clubs in the region, and other smaller teams such as [[Novara Calcio|Novara]], [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]], [[Associazione Sportiva Casale Calcio|Casale]] (1 [[Scudetto]]), [[Pro Vercelli]] (7 [[Scudetto|Scudetti]]) and [[A.C. Cuneo 1905|Cuneo]]. The region currently holds the record for winning the most ''[[Scudetto|Scudetti]]'' ([[Serie A]] championship). Other local teams include volleyball teams Cuneo (male) and Novara (female), basketball teams Biella Basketball and Junior Casale, ice hockey team Hockey Club Turin (team founded in 1947) and roller hockey side [[Amatori Vercelli]], that won three league titles, an Italian Cup and two [[CERS Cup]].

{{See also|Palestinian political violence#Palestinian attitudes towards political violence|l1=Palestinian attitudes towards political violence|Israeli views on the peace process}}

==Background==
[[Palestinians]] have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause.  '[[New Historian]]' Israeli academic [[Ilan Pappe]] says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of [[Israel]] (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] to a [[Palestinian state]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappe, I. 2004&quot;&gt;Pappe, I., 2004, ''A History of Modern Palestine: One Land, Two Peoples'', Cambridge, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as [[Hamas]] still is.  However Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]] and the [[PLO]] initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution.&lt;ref&gt;Slater, J., 2001, What Went Wrong? The Collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, ''Political Science'', Volume 116, Issue 2, Pages 171-199, page 176&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Oslo Accords]] demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the state of Israel’s [[right to exist]] in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[West Bank]]..&lt;ref name=&quot;Slater, J. 2001, Pages 171-199&quot;&gt;Slater, J., 2001, What Went Wrong? The Collapse of the Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process, ''Political Science'', Volume 116, Issue 2, Pages 171-199&lt;/ref&gt; However there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pappe, I. 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bregman, A. &amp; El-Tahri, J., 1998, ''The Sixty Year War: Israel and the Arabs'', London, Penguin Books&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the demand for the &quot;Right of Return&quot; (ROR) by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas who is leading the Palestinian peace effort.

==Yasser Arafat and the PLO==
[[Image:Yasser-arafat-1999.jpg|thumb|200px|Yasser Arafat]]

{{rquote|left|Our basic aim is to liberate the land from the Mediterranean Seas to the Jordan River.... The Palestinian revolution's basic concern is the uprooting of the Zionist entity from our land and liberating it.

The PLO has complex, often contradictory attitudes toward the peace process.  Officially, the PLO acceptance of [[Israel]]'s right to exist in peace was the first of the [[PLO]]'s obligations in the [[Oslo Accords]].  In Yasser Arafat's September 9, 1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]], as part of the first Oslo accord, Arafat stated that &quot;The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aburish |title=From Defender to Dictator |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |pages=201–228 |location=New York |isbn=1-58234-049-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, evidence throughout history and even during the 1990s and 2000s have shown that the PLO leadership considered any peace made with Israel to be temporary until the dream of Israel's destruction could be realized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karsh&quot;&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]].  ''Arafat's War: The Man and His Battle for Israeli Conquest''. New York: Grove Press, 2003.  pp. 57-59, 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dore Gold|Gold, Dore]].  ''The Fight for Jerusalem: Radical Islam, the West, and the Future of the Holy City''.  Washington: Regnery Publishing, Inc., 2007.  p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=May 2013}} Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of &quot;justice&quot; for the Palestinians; terms historian [[Efraim Karsh]] described as &quot;euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from 'foreign occupiers.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karsh&quot; /&gt; When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world, Arafat's rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karsh&quot; /&gt; The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO's second in command [[Abu Iyad]] referred to as &quot;the language of peace&quot; and support of Palestinian terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abu Iyad]] interview with ''al-Fiqr al-Dimuqrati'' (Nicosia), vol. 7, Summer 1989.  qtd. in Karsh, 2003, 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt terrorist activities completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  &quot;Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  Ed. Sela.  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 689-696.&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, terrorism was never fully banned.  Furthermore, assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full, public support of the peace process or condemnation of terrorism without risking further danger to his own life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eran&quot;&gt;Eran, Oded. &quot;Arab-Israel Peacemaking.&quot; ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia''.  Ed. [[Avraham Sela]].  New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 121-147.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2000, after Yasser Arafat rejected [[Camp David 2000 Summit|the offer]] made to him by [[Ehud Barak]] based on the two-state solution and declined to negotiate for a more favorable offer, it became clear that Arafat would not make a deal with Israel unless it included the full [[Palestinian right of return]], which would demographically destroy{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} the Jewish character{{Definition|date=May 2013}} of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Heather.

In 2008, Hamas publicly offered a long-term [[hudna]] (truce) with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and to grant the &quot;[[right of return]]&quot; to all [[Palestinian refugee]]s.  In 2010, Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology.  This represented a departure from their earlier insistence that they would not be bound by any such result.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/hamas-vows-to-honor-palestinian-referendum-on-peace-with-israel-1.328234&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, [[Mousa Abu Marzook]], a high-ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas' top leadership post, gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions, some of which differed from the organisation's actual stance.  He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel, calling instead for a ''hudna'' (temporary truce).  Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh's demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohler&quot;&gt;Cohler-Esses, Larry.

==Prominent Palestinians==
When [[Sari Nusseibeh]] was the representative of the [[Palestinian Authority]] in [[Jerusalem]] (circa 2000), he called for historic compromises by both Palestinians and Israelis, to secure a permanent and lasting peace.  For example, he stated that Palestinians must give up their claim of a [[right of return]].  With this concession, he argued, a true and lasting peace could emerge.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}}

Chief Palestinian negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]] said on August 5, 2000, &quot;Palestinians are no strangers to compromise.  In the 1993 Oslo Accords, we agreed to recognize Israeli sovereignty over 78 percent of historic Palestine and to establish a Palestinian state on only 22 percent.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}} [[Rashid Abu Shbak]], a senior PA security official declared, &quot;The light which has shone over [[Gaza]] and [[Jericho]] [when the PA assumed control over those areas] will also reach the [[Negev]] and the [[Galilee]] [which constitute a large portion of pre-1967 Israel].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Yediot Ahronot, May 29, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The PA's Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by [[Yusuf Abu Sneineh]], official preacher at Jerusalem's [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], over the radio.  In it, he asserted, &quot;The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is: where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone? Where [are] Haifa and Jaffa, Lod and Ramle, Acre, Safed and Tiberias?  Where is Hebron and Jerusalem?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Voice of Palestine, May 23, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Archive/Peace+Process/1997/SENIOR+PALESTINIAN+OFFICIALS+CONTINUE+TO+INCITE+AG.htm?DisplayMode=print &quot;SENIOR PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO INCITE AGAINST ISRAEL.&quot;] ''[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]''.  29 May 1997.  1 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

PA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper, ''Al-Havat Al-Jadida'', on January 4, 1998, &quot;The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which, in its turn, will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[Faisal Husseini]], former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem, compared the [[al-Aqsa intifada]] following the [[Oslo peace process]] to the tactic of coming out of the [[Trojan Horse]] used by the Greeks in the myth of the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

In [[mathematics]], it is possible to combine several [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] into one large '''product ring'''. This is done as follows: if ''I'' is some [[index set]] and ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a ring for every ''i'' in ''I'', then the [[cartesian product]] Π&lt;sub&gt;''i'' in ''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be turned into a ring by defining the operations coordinate-wise.

The resulting ring is called a '''direct product''' of the rings ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The direct product of finitely many rings coincides with the [[direct sum]] of rings.

==Examples==
An important example is the ring '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' of [[integer]]s [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n''. If ''n'' is written as a product of [[prime number|prime]] powers (see [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]):

:&lt;math&gt;n=p_1^{n_1}\  p_2^{n_2}\ \cdots\ p_k^{n_k}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are distinct primes, then '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is naturally [[isomorphic]] to the product ring

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/p_1^{n_1}\mathbf{Z} \ \times \ \mathbf{Z}/p_2^{n_2}\mathbf{Z} \ \times \ \cdots \ \times \ \mathbf{Z}/p_k^{n_k}\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
This follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].

==Properties==
If ''R'' = Π&lt;sub&gt;''i'' in ''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a product of rings, then for every ''i'' in ''I'' we have a [[surjective]] [[ring homomorphism]] ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''R'' → ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' which projects the product on the ''i''-th coordinate. The product ''R'', together with the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', has the following [[universal property]]: 

:if ''S'' is any ring and ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'': ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a ring homomorphism for every ''i'' in ''I'', then there exists ''precisely one'' ring homomorphism ''f'': ''S'' &amp;rarr; ''R'' such that ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' o ''f'' = ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for every ''i'' in ''I''.

This shows that the product of rings is an instance of [[product (category theory)|products in the sense of category theory]]. However, despite also being called the direct sum of rings when ''I'' is finite, the product of rings is not a [[coproduct]] in the sense of category theory. In particular, if ''I'' has more than one element, the inclusion map ''R&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''R'' is not ring homomorphism as it does not map the identity in ''R&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; to the identity in ''R''.

If ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] for each ''i'' in ''I'', then ''A'' = Π&lt;sub&gt;''i'' in ''I''&lt;/sub&gt; ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an ideal of ''R''.  If ''I'' is finite, then the converse is true, i.e. every ideal of ''R'' is of this form.  However, if ''I'' is infinite and the rings ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are non-zero, then the converse is false; the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The ideal ''A'' is a [[prime ideal]] in ''R'' if all but one of the ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are equal to ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the remaining ''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a prime ideal in ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, the converse is not true when ''I'' is infinite. For example, the [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of the ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' form an ideal not contained in any such ''A'', but the [[axiom of choice]] gives that it is contained in some [[maximal ideal]] which is [[a fortiori]] prime.

An element ''x'' in ''R'' is a unit if and only if all of its components are units, i.e. if and only if ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') is a unit in ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' for every ''i'' in ''I''. The group of units of ''R'' is the [[direct product of groups|product]] of the groups of units of ''R&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

A product of more than one non-zero rings always has [[zero divisors]]: if ''x'' is an element of the product all of whose coordinates are zero except ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x''), and ''y'' is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''(''y'') (with ''i'' ≠ ''j''), then ''xy'' = 0 in the product ring.
